  <p>
    Consider the interval <m>(a,b)</m> in <m>\R</m> using the Euclidean metric.
    If <m>m = \frac{a+b}{2}</m>,
    then <m>(a,b) = B\left(m,\frac{b-a}{2}\right)</m>,
    so every open interval is an open ball.
    As an open ball,
    an open interval <m>(a,b)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
    This is the foundation for the definition of an open set in a metric space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that we defined a subset <m>N</m> of <m>X</m> to be neighborhood of point <m>a</m> in a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> if <m>N</m> contains an open ball
    <m>B(a, \epsilon)</m> for some <m>\epsilon > 0</m>.
    We saw that every open ball is a neighborhood of each of its points,
    and we will now extend that idea to define an
    <term>open set</term> in a metric space.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>O</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is an open set<idx><h>open set in a metric space</h></idx> if <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    So, by definition, any open ball is an open set.
    Also by definition,
    open sets are neighborhoods of each of their points.
    Open sets are different than non-open sets.
    For example,
    <m>(0,1)</m> is an open set in <m>\R</m> using the Euclidean metric,
    but <m>[0,1)</m> is not.
    The reason <m>[0,1)</m> is not an open set is that there is no open ball centered at <m>0</m> that is entirely contained in <m>[0,1)</m>.
    So <m>0</m> has a different property than the other points in <m>[0,1)</m>.
    The set <m>[0,1)</m> is a neighborhood of each of the points in <m>(0,1)</m>,
    but is not a neighborhood of <m>0</m>.
    We can think of the points in <m>(0,1)</m> as being in the interior of the set <m>[0,1)</m>.
    This leads to the next definition.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of a metric space <m>X</m>.
        A point <m>a \in A</m> is an interior point<idx><h>interior point in a subset of a metric space</h></idx> of <m>A</m> if <m>A</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As we will soon see,
    open sets can be characterized in terms of interior points.
