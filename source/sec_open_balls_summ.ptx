  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>(X,d)</m> is a metric space and <m>a \in X</m>,
          then an open ball centered at <m>a</m> is a set of the form
          <me>
            B(a,\delta) = \{ x \in X \mid d(x,a) \lt  \delta\}
          </me>
          for some positive number <m>\delta</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>N</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is s neighborhood of a point <m>a \in N</m> if there is a positive real number <m>\delta</m> such that <m>B(a,\delta) \subseteq N</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An important property of open balls is that every open ball is a neighborhood of each of its points.
          This is our first step toward defining the concept of open sets that will form the foundation for topological spaces.

      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a metric space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> is continuous at <m>a \in X</m> if
          <m>f^{-1}(N)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m> in <m>X</m> for any neighborhood <m>N</m> of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
