  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> from a topological space <m>X</m> to a topological space <m>Y</m> is continuous if
          <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open in <m>X</m> whenever <m>O</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Two metric spaces <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> are metrically equivalent if there is a bijection <m>f : X \to Y</m> such that
          <md>
            <mrow>d_X(x,y) \amp = d_Y(f(x),f(y))</mrow>
            <mrow>d_Y(u,v) \amp = d_X(f^{-1}(u), f^{-1}(v))</mrow>
          </md>
          for all <m>x,y \in X</m> and <m>u,v \in Y</m>.
          That is, <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are metrically equivalent if there is a isometry <m>f</m> from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> such that <m>f^{-1}</m> is also an isometry.
          Topological equivalence is a less stringent condition.
          Two topological spaces <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are topologically equivalent if there is a continuous function <m>f</m> from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> such that <m>f^{-1}</m> is also continuous.
          That is, <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are topologically equivalent if there is a homeomorphism between <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A homeomorphism between topological spaces <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> is a continuous function <m>f</m> from <m>X</m> to <m>Y</m> such that <m>f^{-1}</m> is also continuous.
          Two topological spaces <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are homeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism <m>f : X \to Y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A topological invariant is any property that topological space <m>X</m> has that must also be a property of any topological space homeomorphic to <m>X</m>.
          We can sometimes use topological invariants to determine if two topological spaces are not homeomorphic.
