  <title>Unions and Intersections of Closed Sets</title>
  <p>
    Now we have defined open and closed sets in topological spaces.
    In our preview activity we saw that a set can be both open and closed.
    As we did in metric spaces,
    we will call any set that is both open and closed a
    <term>clopen</term><idx><h>clopen set in a topological space</h></idx>
    (for closed-open)
    set.
  </p>
  <p>
    By definition,
    any union and any finite intersection of open sets in a topological space is open,
    so the fact that closed sets are complements of open sets implies the following theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_closed_TS">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any intersection of closed sets in <m>X</m> is a closed set in <m>X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any finite union of closed sets in <m>X</m> is a closed set in <m>X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.
      To prove part 1, assume that
      <m>C_{\alpha}</m> is a collection of closed set in <m>X</m> for <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        X \setminus \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} C_{\alpha} = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} X \setminus C_{\alpha}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter is an arbitrary union of open sets and so it an open set.
      By definition, then,
      <m>\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} C_{\alpha}</m> is a closed set.
    </p>
    <p>
      For part 2, assume that <m>C_1</m>,
      <m>C_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>C_n</m> are closed sets in <m>X</m> for some <m>n \in \Z^+</m>.
      To show that <m>C = \bigcap_{k=1}^n C_k</m> is a closed set,
      we will show that <m>X \setminus C</m> is an open set.
      Now
      <me>
        X \setminus \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} C_{\alpha} = \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} X \setminus C_{\alpha}
      </me>
      is a finite intersection of open sets, and so is an open set.
      Therefore, <m>\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} C_{\alpha}</m> is a closed set.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_closed_TS"/>
    tells us that any intersection of closed sets is closed,
    but only finite unions of closed sets are closed.
    How do we know that non-finite unions of closed sets aren't necessarily closed?

  <activity>
    <p>
      Let <m>\Z</m> be a topological space with the finite complement topology <m>\tau_{FC}</m>.
      That is, a non-empty set <m>O</m> is open in <m>\Z</m> if <m>\Z \setminus O</m> is finite.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What must be true about the cardinality of the closed sets in <m>(\Z, \tau_{FC})</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>C_n = \{2, 3, \ldots, n\}</m>.
            Is the set <m>\bigcup_{n \geq 3} C_n</m> a closed set in <m>(\Z, \tau_{FC})</m>?
            Explain.
