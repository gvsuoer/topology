  <title>Products of Metric Spaces</title>
  <p>
    If we have two metric spaces
    <m>(X, d_1)</m> and <m>(X_2 ,d_2)</m>,
    we might wonder if we can make the set <m>X_1 \times X_2</m> into a metric space.
    A natural approach might be to define a function <m>d : (X_1 \times X_2) \times (X_1 \times X_2) \to \R</m> by
    <me>
      d((x,y),(u,v)) = d_1(x,u)d_2(y,v)
    </me>
    for <m>(x,y)</m> and <m>(u,v)</m> in <m>X_1 \times X_2</m>.
    However, this <m>d</m> does not define a metric.
    For example,
    if <m>x \in X_1</m> and <m>y \neq v</m> in <m>X_2</m>,
    then <m>d((x,y),(x,v)) = 0</m> even though <m>(x,y) \neq (x,v)</m>.
    To make a metric,
    we can take a clue from the Euclidean metric on <m>\R \times \R</m>.
    On <m>\R</m>, the metric has the form <m>d_1(x,y) = |x-y|</m>,
    while on <m>\R^2</m> the metric is
    <me>
      d_E((x_1,x_2), (y_1,y_2)) = \sqrt{ (x_1-y_1)^2 + (x_2-y_2)^2} = \sqrt{d_1(x_1,y_1)^2 + d_1(x_2,y_2)^2}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So on <m>(X, d_1)</m> and <m>(X_2 ,d_2)</m> we could consider defining <m>d : (X_1 \times X_2) \times (X_1 \times X_2) \to \R</m> by
    <me>
      d((x_1,x_2), (y_1,y_2)) = \sqrt{ d_1(x_1,y_1)^2 + d_2(x_2,y_2)^2}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    We show that <m>d</m> is a metric If <m>x=(x_1,x_2)</m> and
    <m>y=(y_1,y_2)</m> are in <m>X_1 \times X_2</m>,
    then <m>d(x,y) = \sqrt{ d_1(x_1,y_1)^2 + d_2(x_2,y_2)^2}</m> is nonnegative by definition.
    Also, the symmetry of <m>d_1</m> and <m>d_2</m> imply that <m>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</m>.
    Note that <m>d(x,y) = 0</m> if and only if <m>d_1(x_1,y_1) = d_2(x_2,y_2) = 0</m>.
    But this happens if and only if <m>x_1=y_1</m> and <m>x_2=y_2</m>,
    or if <m>x = y</m>.
    The last (and most difficult) property to verify is the triangle inequality.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>z = (z_1, z_2)</m> be in <m>X_1 \times X_2</m>.
    Then
    <md>
      <mrow>d(x,z)^2 \amp =  d_1(x_1,z_1)^2 + d_2(x_2,z_2)^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \leq \left(d_1(x_1,y_1) + d_1(y_1,z_1)\right)^2 + \left(d_2(x_2,y_2) + d_2(y_2,z_2)\right)^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \left(d_1(x_1,y_1)^2 + d_2(x_2,y_2)^2\right) + 2\left(d_1(x_1,y_1)d_1(y_1,z_1) + d_2(x_2,y_2)d_2(y_2,z_2)\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \qquad + \left(d_1(y_1,z_1)^2 + d_2(y_2,z_2)^2\right)</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = d(x,y)^2 + 2\left(d_1(x_1,y_1)d_1(y_1,z_1) + d_2(x_2,y_2)d_2(y_2,z_2)\right) + d(y,z)^2</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp \leq d(x,y)^2 + d(y,z)^2</mrow>
    </md>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since all terms are non-negative we conclude that
    <md>
      <mrow>d(x,z) \leq \sqrt{d(x,y)^2 + d(y,z)^2} \amp \leq \sqrt{d(x,y)^2 + 2 d(x,y)d(y,z) + d(y,z)^2}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = \sqrt{\left(d(x,y)+d(y,z)\right)^2}</mrow>
      <mrow>\amp = d(x,y) + d(y,z)</mrow>
    </md>.

    In the next activity we consider products of open balls and open sets in products oif metric spaces.

  <activity xml:id="act_ms_product_open">
    <p>

    <xref ref="act_ms_product_open"/>
    shows that open sets in a product are more complicated than just products of open sets in the factors.
    We will return to product later when we consider topological spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    We conclude with one final comment about products.
    We can make the Cartesian product of any number of metric spaces into a metric space with the same construction we used for the product of two spaces.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X_i, d_i)</m> be metric spaces for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to some positive integer <m>n</m>.
        The product metric space
            <idx><h>product metric space</h></idx>
        <m>(X,d)</m> is the Cartesian product
        <me>
          X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots \times X_n = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i
        </me>
        with metric <m>d</m> defined by
        <me>
          d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n d_i(x_i,y_i)^2}
        </me>
        when <m>x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots,
        x_n)</m> and <m>y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)</m> are in <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    The metric <m>d</m> is called the <term>product metric</term>
        <idx><h>product metric</h></idx>
    and the spaces <m>(X_i,d_i)</m> are called the <term>coordinate</term>
        <idx><h>coordinate space</h></idx>
    or <term>factor</term>
        <idx><h>factor space</h></idx>
    spaces of <m>(X,d)</m>.
    The proof that <m>d</m> is a metric is essentially the same as in the <m>n=2</m> case,
    and is left to Exercise <xref ref="ex_prod_metric"/>.
