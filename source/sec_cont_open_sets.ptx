  <title>Continuity and Open Sets</title>
  <p>
    Recall that we showed that a function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a metric space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> is continuous if and only if
    <m>f^{-1}(N)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a \in X</m> whenever <m>N</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
    We can now provide another characterization of continuous functions in terms of open sets.
    This is the characterization that will serve as our definition of continuity in topological spaces.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Open_continuity">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f</m> be a function from a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a metric space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m>.
        Then <m>f</m> is continuous if and only if
        <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m> whenever <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>Y</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X, d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> be metric spaces,
      and let <m>f : X \to Y</m> be a function.
      To prove this biconditional statement we need to prove both implications.
      First assume that <m>f</m> is a continuous function.
      We must show that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m> for every open set <m>O</m> in <m>Y</m>.
      So let <m>O</m> be an open set in <m>Y</m>.
      To demonstrate that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
      we will show that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
      Let <m>a \in f^{-1}(O)</m>.
      Then <m>f(a) \in O</m>.
      Now <m>O</m> is an open set,
      so there is an open ball <m>B(f(a), \epsilon)</m> around <m>f(a)</m> that is entirely contained in <m>O</m>.
      Since <m>B(f(a), \epsilon)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m>,
      we know that <m>f^{-1}(B(f(a), \epsilon))</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
      Thus, there exists <m>\delta \gt 0</m> so that <m>B(a, \delta) \subseteq f^{-1}(B(f(a), \epsilon))</m>.
      Now <m>f(B(a, \delta)) \subseteq B(f(a), \epsilon) \subseteq O</m>,
      and so <m>B(a, \delta) \subseteq f^{-1}(O)</m>.
      We conclude that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and is therefore an open set in <m>X</m>.

      The proof of the reverse implication is left for the next activity.

    Recall that every open set is a union of open balls,
    so we can simplify proofs of continuous functions in metric spaces by working only with open balls instead of arbitrary open sets.
    The next activity provides the details.

  <activity xml:id="act_continuity_balls">

      In this activity we prove the following corollary to <xref ref="thm_Open_continuity"/>.
    </p>
    <corollary xml:id="cor_continuity_balls">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a metric space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> is continuous if and only if
          <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m> whenever <m>B</m> is an open ball in <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </corollary>
    <p>
      To set up the proof,
      let <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> be metric spaces,
      and let <m>f: X \to Y</m> be a function.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Since the corollary is a biconditional statement,
            we need to prove both implications.
            First, assume that <m>f</m> is continuous.
            Use <xref ref="thm_Open_continuity"/>
            to explain why <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m> whenever <m>B</m> is an open ball in <m>Y</m>.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            For the remaining implication,
            assume that <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m> for any open ball <m>B</m> in <m>Y</m>.
            To show that <m>f</m> is a continuous function,
            we will use <xref ref="thm_Open_continuity"/>
            and show that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open in <m>X</m> whenever <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>Y</m>.
            So let <m>O</m> be an open set in <m>Y</m>.

                  Use <xref ref="lem_functions_subsets"/>
                  to show that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open in <m>X</m> and conclude that <m>f</m> is a continuous function.

  <example xml:id="exp_linear_continuous">
    <statement>
      <p>
        As an example of <xref ref="cor_continuity_balls"/>,
        we prove that the square function from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m> is a continuous function.
        Let <m>X = \R</m> with the Euclidean metric <m>d_E</m>,
        and let <m>f: X \to X</m> be defined by <m>f(x) = x^2</m>.
        We will show that <m>f</m> is a continuous function by verifying that
        <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m> for every open ball <m>B</m> in <m>X</m>.
        Let <m>B = B(b,\beta) = (b-\beta,
        b+\beta)</m> be an open ball in <m>X</m>.
        Let <m>B' = B(b,\beta) \cap (\R^+ \cup \{0\})</m>.
        We consider cases.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>B' = \emptyset</m>.
              Then <m>f^{-1}(B) = \emptyset</m> and <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Suppose that <m>B' = [0, b+\beta)</m>.
              Then <m>f^{-1}(B) = (-\sqrt{b+\beta}, \sqrt{b+\beta})</m> and <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The final case is <m>B' = (b-\beta, b+\beta)</m>.
              Then
              <me>
                f^{-1}(B) = (-\sqrt{b+\beta}, -\sqrt{b-\beta}) \cup (\sqrt{b-\beta}, \sqrt{b+\beta})
              </me>
              and <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m>.

          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the inverse image of every open ball is an open set,
        we conclude that <m>f</m> is a continuous function.
