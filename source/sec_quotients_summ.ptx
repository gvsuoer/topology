  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>(X,\tau_X)</m> be a topological space,
          let <m>Y</m> be a set, and let <m>p: X \to Y</m> be a surjection.
          The quotient topology on <m>Y</m> is the set
          <me>
            \{U \subseteq Y \mid p^{-1}(U) \in \tau_X\}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The function <m>p</m> is a quotient topology as in the previous bullet is called a quotient map and the space <m>Y</m> is a quotient space.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A circle, a M&#xf6;bius strip, a torus,
          and a sphere can all be realized as quotient spaces.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
