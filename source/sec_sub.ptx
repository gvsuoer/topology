  <p>
    We have seen that a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> is a subspace of <m>X</m> using the restriction of the metric <m>d_X</m> to <m>A</m>.
    We do not have a metric in general topological spaces,
    so that approach can't be duplicated.
    But, we proved that the open sets in a subspace <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> are exactly the intersections of open sets in <m>X</m> with <m>A</m>.
    That idea can be transferred to topological spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make a subspace <m>A</m> of a topological space
    <m>(X,\tau)</m> into a topological space,
    we need to define a topology on <m>A</m>.

      Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space and <m>A</m> a nonempty subset of <m>X</m>.
      It is reasonable to use the open sets in <m>X</m> to define open sets in <m>A</m>.
      More specifically,
      we might consider a subset <m>O_A</m> of <m>A</m> to be open in <m>A</m> if <m>O_A</m> is the intersection of <m>A</m> with some open set in <m>X</m>,
      as illustrated in <xref ref="F_Subspace_open">Figure</xref>.
      With this in mind we define <m>\tau_A</m> as
      <me>
        \tau_A = \{O \cap A \mid O \in \tau\}
      </me>.

          Show that <m>\tau_A</m> is a topology on <m>A</m>.
          The result of item (1) is that any subset of a topological space
          <m>(X,\tau)</m> is also a topological space with topology <m>\tau_A</m>.
