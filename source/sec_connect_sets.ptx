  <title>Connected Sets</title>

    As we learned in our preview activity,
    connected sets are those sets that cannot be separated into a union of disjoint open sets.
    Another characterization of connectedness is established in the next activity.

      Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume that <m>X</m> is a connected space,
            and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m> that is both open and closed.
            What happens if we combine <m>A</m> and <m>X \setminus A</m>?
            What does the fact that <m>X</m> is connected tell us about <m>A</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Now assume that the only subsets of <m>X</m> that are both open and closed are <m>\emptyset</m> and <m>X</m>.
            Must it follow that <m>X</m> is connected?
            Prove your assertion.

            Summarize the result of this activity into a theorem of the form ``A topological space

    A standard example of a connected topological space is the metric space <m>(\R, d_E)</m>.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_R_connected">
    <statement>
      <p>
        The metric space <m>(\R, d_E)</m> is a connected topological space.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      We proceed by contradiction and assume that there are nonempty open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> such that
      <m>\R = U \cup V</m> and <m>U \cap V = \emptyset</m>.
      Let <m>a \in U</m> and <m>b \in V</m>.
      Since <m>U \cap V = \emptyset</m>,
      we know that <m>a \neq b</m>.
      Without loss of generality we can assume <m>a \lt b</m>.
      Let <m>U' = U \cap [a,b]</m> and let <m>V' = V \cap [a,b]</m>.
      The set <m>V'</m> is bounded below by <m>a</m>,
      so <m>x = \inf\{v \mid v \in V'\}</m> exists.
      Since <m>\R = U \cup V</m> it must be the case that <m>x \in U</m> or <m>x \in V</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>x \in U</m>.
      The fact that <m>U</m> is an open set implies that there exists
      <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m> such that <m>B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq U</m>.
      But then <m>B(x, \epsilon) \cap V = \emptyset</m> and so
      <m>d(x,v) \geq \epsilon</m> for every <m>v \in V</m>.
      This means that <m>x+\epsilon \lt v</m> for every <m>v \in V'</m>,
      contradicting the fact that <m>x</m> is the greatest lower bound.
      We conclude that <m>x \notin U</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that <m>x \in V</m>.
      Since <m>a \in U</m>, we know that <m>x \neq a</m>.
      The fact that <m>V</m> is an open set tells us that there exists
      <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that <m>B(x, \delta) \subseteq V</m>.
      We can choose <m>\delta</m> to ensure that <m>\delta \lt x-a</m>.
      Since <m>x > a</m>, the interval
      <m>(x-\delta,
      x)</m> is a subset of <m>V'</m>,
      and so <m>x</m> is not a lower bound for <m>V</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each possibility leads to a contradiction,
      so we conclude that the sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> cannot exist.
      Therefore, <m>(\R, d_E)</m> is a connected topological space.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    As you might expect, connectedness is a topological property.

  <activity>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> and
      <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m> be topological spaces,
      and let <m>f : X \to Y</m> be a continuous function.
      Assume that <m>X</m> is a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
      Our goal is to prove that <m>f(X)</m> is a connected subspace of <m>Y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let <m>Z = f(X)</m> and define
      <m>g: X \to Z</m> by <m>g(x) = f(x)</m>.
      Then <m>g</m> is a continuous function that maps <m>X</m> onto <m>Z</m>.
      So we consider <m>g</m> instead of <m>f</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assume to the contrary that <m>Z</m> is not connected.
            What do we then assume about <m>Z</m>?

    The fact that connectedness is preserved by continuous functions means that connectedness is a property that is shared by any homeomorphic topological spaces,
    as the next corollary indicates.
  </p>
  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> and
        <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m> be homeomorphic topological spaces.
        Then <m>X</m> is connected if and only if <m>Y</m> is connected.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> and
      <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m> be topological spaces and let <m>f: X \to Y</m> be a homeomorphism.
      Assume that <m>X</m> is connected.
      Since <m>f</m> is continuous,
      <xref ref="thm_connected_invariant"/>
      shows that <m>f(X) = Y</m> is connected.
      The reverse implication follows from the fact that <m>f^{-1}</m> is a homeomorphism.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Recall that <m>(\R,d_E)</m> is homeomorphic to the topological subspaces <m>(a,b)</m>,
    <m>(-\infty,
    b)</m>, and <m>(a,\infty)</m> for any <m>a, b \in \R</m>.
    The fact that <m>(\R, d_E)</m> is connected
    (<xref ref="thm_R_connected"/>)
    allows us to conclude that all open intervals are connected.
    It would seem natural that all closed
    (or half-closed)
    intervals should also be connected.
    We address this question next.
    Before we get to this result,
    we consider an alternate formulation of connected subsets.
  </p>
  <p>
    Consider the set <m>A = (-1,0) \cup (4,5)</m> in <m>\R</m>.
    Let <m>U = (-2,3)</m> and <m>V=(2,6)</m> in <m>\R</m>.
    Note that <m>U' = U \cap A = (-1,0)</m> and <m>V' = V \cap A = (4,5)</m>,
    and so <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are open sets in <m>\R</m> that separate the set <m>A</m> into two disjoint pieces.
    We know that <m>U'</m> and <m>V'</m> are open in <m>A</m> and
    <m>A = U' \cup V'</m> with <m>U' \cap V' = \emptyset</m>.
    So to show that a subset of a topological space <m>X</m> is not connected,
    this example suggests that it suffices to find nonempty open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> in <m>X</m> with
    <m>U \cap V \cap A = \emptyset</m> and <m>A \subseteq (U \cup V)</m>.
    Note that it is not necessary to have <m>U \cap V = \emptyset</m>.
    That this works in general is the result of the next theorem.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_conn_subset">

        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      We first assume that <m>A</m> is disconnected and show that there are open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> in <m>X</m> that satisfy the given conditions.
      Since <m>A</m> is disconnected,
      there are nonempty open sets <m>U'</m> and <m>V'</m> in <m>A</m> such that
      <m>U' \cup V' = A</m> and <m>U' \cap V' = \emptyset</m>.
      Since <m>U'</m> and <m>V'</m> are open in <m>A</m>,
      there exist open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> in <m>X</m> so that
      <m>U' = U \cap A</m> and <m>V' = V \cap A</m>.
      Now
      <me>
        A = U' \cup V' = (U \cap A) \cup (V \cap A) = (U \cup V) \cap A
      </me>,
      and so <m>A \subseteq U \cup V</m>.
      By construction,
      <m>U \cap A = U'</m> and <m>V \cap A = V'</m> are not empty.
      Finally,
      <me>
        U \cap V \cap A = (U \cap A) \cap (V \cap A) = U' \cap V' = \emptyset
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So we have found sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> that satisfy the conditions of our theorem.
