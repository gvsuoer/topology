  <p>
    In this section we consider three specific examples of a product of topological spaces.

      Let <m>X = [1,2]</m> and <m>Y = [3,4]</m> as subspaces of <m>\R^2</m>.

          <p>
            Explain in detail what the product space <m>X \times Y</m> looks like.

        <li>
          <p>
            Find, if possible, an open subset of
            <m>X \times Y</m> that is not of the form
            <m>U \times V</m> where <m>U</m> is open in <m>X</m> and <m>V</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.

      Let <m>X = \R</m> and <m>Y = S^1 = \{(x,y) \mid x^2 + y^2 = 1\}</m>,
      the unit circle as a subset of <m>\R^2</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Draw a picture of <m>\R</m>.
            For each <m>x \in \R</m>,
            the set <m>\R_x = \{(x, y) \mid y \in S^1\}</m> is a subset of <m>\R \times S^1</m>.
            On your graph of <m>\R</m>,
            draw pictures of <m>\R_x</m> for <m>x</m> equal to <m>-1</m>,
            <m>0</m>,
            and <m>1</m>.

            Consider the sets of the form <m>B \cap S^1</m>,
            where <m>B</m> is an open ball in <m>\R^2</m>
            (relatively open sets in <m>S^1</m>).
            What do these sets look like?
          </p>

            Describe the shape of the basis elements for the product topology on
            <m>\R \times S^1</m> that result from products of the form <m>U \times V</m>,
            where <m>U</m> is an open interval in <m>\R</m> and <m>V</m> is the intersections of <m>S^1</m> with an open ball in <m>\R^2</m>.

      Let <m>2S^1 = \{(x,y) \mid x^2 + y^2 = 4\}</m> be the circle of radius <m>2</m> centered at the origin as a subset of <m>\R^2</m>.
      In this activity we investigate the space <m>2S^1 \times S^1</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Draw a picture of <m>2S^1</m> in the <m>xy</m>-plane.
            For each <m>p \in S^1</m>,
            the set <m>S^1_p = \{(p, y) \mid y \in S^1\}</m> is a subset of <m>S^1 \times S^1</m>.
            On your graph of <m>S^1</m>,
            draw pictures of <m>S^1_p</m> for <m>p</m> equal to <m>(1,0)</m>,
            <m>\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)</m>,
            and <m>(0,1)</m>.
            Orient the graphs so that the copies of <m>S^1</m> are perpendicular to <m>2S^1</m>.
            Explain in detail what the product space <m>2S^1 \times S^1</m> looks like.
