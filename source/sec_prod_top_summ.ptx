  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    Throughout, let <m>(X_i, \tau_i)</m> be topological spaces for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to some integer <m>n</m>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The product of the <m>X_i</m> is the Cartesian product <m>\Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set
          <me>
            \CB = \left\{ \Pi_{i=1}^n O_i \mid O_i \text{ is open in }  X_i\right\}
          </me>
          is a basis for the box topology on <m>\Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The mapping <m>\pi_j : \Pi_{i=1}^n X_i \to X_j</m> defined by
          <m>\pi_j((x_i)) = x_j</m> is the projection map onto <m>X_j</m> for <m>j</m> from 1 to <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> mapping a topological space <m>Y</m> to
          <m>\Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m> is continuous if and only if
          <m>\pi_j \circ f</m> is continuous for every <m>j</m> from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space.
          A subset <m>\CS</m> of <m>\tau</m> is a subbasis for <m>\tau</m> if the set <m>\CS</m> of all finite intersections of elements of <m>\CS</m> is a basis for <m>\tau</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If each <m>X_i</m> is (a) connected, (b) path connected, (c) compact,
          then <m>\Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m> is (a) connected, (b) path connected, (c) compact with respect to the product topology.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
