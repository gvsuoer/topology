  <title>Bases for Subspaces</title>
  <p>
    Recall that a basis <m>\B</m> for a topological space is a collection of sets that generate all of the open sets through unions.
    If we have a basis <m>\B</m> for a topological space <m>(X, \tau)</m>,
    and if <m>A</m> is a subspace of <m>X</m>,
    we might ask if we can find a basis <m>\B_A</m> from <m>\B</m> in a natural way.

      Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space with basis <m>\B</m>,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subspace of <m>X</m>.

            There is a natural candidate to consider as a basis <m>\B_A</m> for <m>A</m>.
            How do you think we should define the elements in <m>\B_A</m>?

            Recall that a set <m>\B</m> is a basis for a topological space <m>X</m> if
          
            <ol>
              <li>
                <p>
                  For each <m>x \in X</m>,
                  there is a set in <m>\B</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>x \in X</m> is an element of
                  <m>B_1 \cap B_2</m> for some <m>B_1, B_2 \in B</m>,
                  then there is a set <m>B_3 \in \B</m> such that <m>x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2</m>.

          Show that your set from (a) is a basis for the induced topology on <m>A</m>.
