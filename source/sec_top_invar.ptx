  <title>Topological Invariants</title>
  <p>
    Homeomorphic topological spaces are essentially the same from a topological perspective,
    and they share many properties, but not all.
    The properties they share are called
    <term>topological invariants</term>
    or <term>topological properties</term>.

        A property of a topological space <m>X</m> is a topological property
        (or topological invariant
        ) if every topological space homeomorphic to <m>X</m> has the same property.

      Which of the following are topological invariants?
      That is for topological spaces
      <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> and <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m>,
      if <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are homeomorphic space and <m>X</m> has the property,
      does it follow that <m>Y</m> must also have that property?
