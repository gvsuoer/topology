    Suppose we consider a sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> that converges to a point <m>x</m>.
    Must it be the case that <m>x \in A</m>?
    We consider this question in the next activity.

    The result of <xref ref="act_closed_limitpoints"/>
    is encapsulated in the next theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_Closed_convergent">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>C</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if whenever <m>(c_n)</m> is a sequence in <m>C</m> that converges to a point <m>c \in X</m>,
        then <m>c \in C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>C</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
      First assume that <m>C</m> is closed.
      Let <m>(c_n)</m> be a convergent sequence in <m>C</m> with <m>c = \lim c_n</m>.
      So either <m>c \in C</m> or <m>c</m> is a limit point of <m>C</m>.
      Since <m>C</m> contains its limit points,
      either case gives us <m>c \in C</m>.
      So <m>\lim c_n \in C</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof of the remaining implication is left to the next activity.

      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>C</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
      In this activity we will prove that if any time a sequence <m>(c_n)</m> in <m>C</m> converges to a point <m>c \in X</m>,
      the point <m>c</m> is in <m>C</m>,
      then <m>C</m> is a closed set.

            List three different ways that we can show that a subset of a metric space is closed.
            Which one might be relevant in this situation to show that the set <m>C</m> is closed?
