    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.

          A topology on a set <m>X</m> is a collection of open subsets of <m>X</m>.
          More specifically,
          a set <m>\tau</m> of subsets of a set <m>X</m> is a topology on <m>X</m> if
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>X</m> and <m>\emptyset</m> belong to <m>\tau</m>,
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                any union of sets in <m>\tau</m> is a set in <m>\tau</m>, and
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                any finite intersection of sets in <m>\tau</m> is a set in <m>\tau</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        A topological space is a set along with a topology on the set.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Any arbitrary union of open sets is open and any finite intersection of open sets is open in a topological space.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          It can be difficult to completely describe the open sets in a topology,
          and it can be difficult to work with arbitrary open sets.
          If a collection of simpler sets generate a topology,
          that collection of simpler sets is a basis for the topology.
          More formally set <m>\B</m> is a basis for a topology on a set <m>X</m> if
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                For each <m>x \in X</m>,
                there is a set in <m>\B</m> that contains <m>x</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                If <m>x \in X</m> is an element of
                <m>B_1 \cap B_2</m> for some <m>B_1, B_2 \in B</m>,
                then there is a set <m>B_3 \in \B</m> such that <m>x \in B_3 \subseteq B_1 \cap B_2</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is a neighborhood of a point <m>a \in A</m> if there is an open set <m>O</m> contained in <m>A</m> such that <m>a \in O</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A point <m>x</m> in a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is an interior point of <m>A</m> if <m>A</m> is a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
          The interior of set <m>A</m> is the collection of all interior points of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is open if and only if <m>A</m> is equal to its interior.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
