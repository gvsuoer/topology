  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is a metric space,
          called a subspace,
          by using the metric <m>d|_{A \times A}</m> on <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>X</m> is a metric space and <m>A</m> is a subspace of <m>X</m>,
          a subset <m>O_A</m> of <m>A</m> is open in <m>A</m> if and only if
          <m>O_A = X \cap O</m> for some open set <m>O</m> in <m>X</m>.
          A subset <m>C_A</m> of <m>A</m> is closed in <m>A</m> if
          <m>C_A = A \cap O_A</m> for open set <m>O_A</m> in <m>A</m>.
          Alternatively, a set <m>C_A</m> is closed in <m>A</m> if
          <m>C_A = A \cap C</m> for some closed set <m>C</m> in <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>(X_i, d_i)</m> be metric spaces for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to some positive integer <m>n</m>.
          The product metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is the Cartesian product
          <me>
            X = X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots \times X_n = \prod_{i=1}^n X_i
          </me>
          with metric <m>d</m> defined by
          <me>
            d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n d_i(x_i,y_i)^2}
          </me>
          when <m>x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots,
          x_n)</m> and <m>y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)</m> are in <m>X</m>.
