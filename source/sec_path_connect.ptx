  <title>Path Connectedness</title>
  <p>
    As with every new property we define,
    it is natural to ask if path connectedness is a topological property.
  </p>

  <activity>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this activity we prove <xref ref="thm_path_connected"/>.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_path_connected">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces and let
          <m>f : X \to Y</m> be a continuous function.
          If <m>A</m> is a path connected subspace of <m>X</m>,
          then <m>f(A)</m> is a path connected subspace of <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      Assume that <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are topological spaces,
      <m>f : X \to Y</m> is a continuous function,
      and <m>A \subseteq X</m> is path connected.
      To prove that <m>f(A)</m> is path connected,
      we choose two elements <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>f(A)</m>.
      It follows that there exist elements <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>A</m> such that <m>f(a) = u</m> and <m>f(b) = v</m>.

  </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain why there is a continuous function
            <m>p: [0,1] \to A</m> such that <m>p(0) = a</m> and <m>p(1) = b</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Determine how <m>p</m> and <m>f</m> can be used to define a path
            <m>q: [0,1] \to f(A)</m> from <m>u</m> to <m>v</m>.
            Be sure to explain why <m>q</m> is a path.
            Conclude that <m>f(A)</m> is path connected.

  <p>
    A consequence of <xref ref="thm_path_connected"/> is the following.

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Path connectedness is a topological property.
