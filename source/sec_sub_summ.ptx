  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subspace of a topological space is any nonempty subset of the topological space endowed with the subspace topology.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          An open subset in the subspace topology for a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is any set of the form <m>O \cap A</m>,
          where <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The relatively open sets are the open sets in a subspace topology.
          The relatively closed sets are complements of the relatively open sets in a subspace topology.
          That is, a relatively closed set in the subspace <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> are the sets of the form <m>A \cap C</m>,
          where <m>C</m> is a closed set in <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The topological space <m>\R</m> with the standard topology is homeomorphic to any open interval as well as open intervals of the form <m>(a,\infty)</m> or
          <m>(-\infty,b)</m> for any real numbers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
