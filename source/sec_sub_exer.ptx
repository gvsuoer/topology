    <statement>
      <p>
        A property of a topological space is said to be hereditary if that property is inherited by every subspace.
        We state this more formally in the following definition.
      </p>
        <definition>
          <idx><h>hereditary property</h></idx>
          <statement>
            <p>
              A property <m>P</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is <term>hereditary</term>
              if every subspace of <m>X</m> also has property <m>P</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </definition>
      <p>
        Show that properties <m>T_1</m>,
        <m>T_2</m>, and <m>T_3</m> are hereditary.
        (The separation axioms <m>T_i</m> are found in <xref ref="chap_Closed_sets_topology"/>.)
        The fact that <m>T_4</m> is not hereditary is somewhat difficult.
        One example is the Tychonoff plank
        (which is normal)
        with the Deleted Tychonoff plank
        (which is not normal)
        as subspace.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Suppose that <m>f : X \to Y</m> is a homeomorphism from a topological space <m>X</m> to a topological space <m>Y</m>.
        Let <m>a \in X</m>.
        Must the subspace <m>X' = X \setminus \{a\}</m> of <m>X</m> be homeomorphic to the subspace <m>Y' = Y \setminus \{f(a)\}</m> of <m>Y</m>?

        For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true.
        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
        If a statement is true, explain why.
