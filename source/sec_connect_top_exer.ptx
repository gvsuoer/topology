        Recall from <xref ref="def_weaker_topologies"/>
        on <xref ref="def_weaker_topologies">page</xref>
        that if <m>\tau_1</m> and <m>\tau_2</m> are two topologies on a set <m>X</m> such that <m>\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2</m>,
        then <m>\tau_1</m> is said to be a <term>coarser</term>
        (or <term>weaker</term>)
        topology than <m>\tau_2</m>, or <m>\tau_2</m> is a <term>finer</term>
        (or <term>stronger</term>)
        topology than <m>\tau_1</m>.
        In this exercise we explore the question of whether compactness is a property that is passed from weaker to stronger topologies or from stronger to weaker.
        Let <m>\tau_1</m> and <m>\tau_2</m> be two topologies on a set <m>X</m>.
        If <m>\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2</m>,
        what does connectedness under <m>\tau_1</m> or <m>\tau_2</m> imply,
        if anything, about compactness under the other topology?
        Justify your answers.

        Prove that there is a <m>w</m> between <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> such that <m>f(w)(b-a) = \int_a^b f(t) \, dt</m>.

        Even though <m>X = (0,1) \cup (1,2)</m> is not a connected space,
        if <m>x</m> is any element in <m>X</m> then we can surround <m>x</m> with a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
        This is the idea of local connectedness.

            <p>
              A topological space <m>X</m> is locally connected at a point <m>x \in X</m> if every neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m> contains an open connected neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
              A topological space <m>X</m> is locally connected
          <idx><h>locally connected</h></idx>
              if <m>X</m> is locally connected at each point in <m>X</m>.

              It would be reasonable to believe that a connected space is locally connected.
              However, that is not the case.
              Consider the space <m>X = A \cup B</m> as a subspace of <m>\R^2</m> with the standard Euclidean metric topology,
              where <m>A = \{(x,y) \mid x \text{ is irrational and } 0 \leq y \leq 1\}</m> and <m>B = \{(x,y) \mid x \text{ is rational and } -1 \leq y \leq 0\}</m>.

        <m>f : X \to Y</m> a continuous function.
        Is it the case that if <m>S</m> is a cut set of <m>X</m>,
        then <m>f(S)</m> is a cut set of <m>Y</m>?
        Prove your answer.

        Let <m>X = \{a,b,c,d\}</m>.
        There are 355 distinct topologies on <m>X</m>,
        but they fit into the 33 distinct homeomorphism classes listed below.
        The list is ordered by decreasing number of singleton sets in the topology, and,
        when that is fixed,
        by increasing number of two-point subsets and then by increasing number of three-point subsets.
        Under which topologies is <m>X</m> connected?
        Prove your answer.

        For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true.
        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
