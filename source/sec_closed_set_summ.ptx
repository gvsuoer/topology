  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
          <ol label="i">
            <li>
              <p>
                A point <m>x \in X</m> is a boundary point of <m>A</m> if every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> and a point in <m>X \setminus A</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A point <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>A</m> if every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> different from <m>x</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                A point <m>a \in A</m> is an isolated point of <m>A</m> if there is a neighborhood <m>N</m> of <m>a</m> such that <m>N \cap A = \{a\}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        Boundary points and limit points don't need to be in the set <m>A</m>,
        whereas an isolated point of <m>A</m> must be in <m>A</m>.
        In <m>A = (0,1) \cup \{2\}</m> as a subset of <m>=(\R, d_E)</m>,
        <m>0</m> is a boundary point but not an isolated point while <m>2</m> is a boundary point but not a limit point.
        Also, <m>0.5</m> is a limit point but neither a boundary or isolated point.
        With <m>A</m> as subset of <m>\R</m> with the discrete metric,
        every point of <m>A</m> is an isolated point but no point in <m>\R</m> is a boundary point or a limit point of <m>A</m>.
        So even though every boundary point is either a limit point or an isolated point,
        the three concepts are different.
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is closed if <m>X \setminus A</m> is an open set.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Any intersection of closed sets is closed while finite unions of closed sets are closed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>X</m> to a metric space <m>Y</m> is continuous if
          <m>f^{-1}(C)</m> is a closed set in <m>X</m> whenever <m>C</m> is a closed set in <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a metric space,
          let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>,
          and let <m>x</m> be a limit point of <m>A</m>.
          Then there is a sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>A</m> that converges to <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a metric space,
          let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>,
          and let <m>x</m> be a boundary point of <m>A</m>.
          Then there are sequences <m>(x_n)</m> in
          <m>X \setminus A</m> and <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>A</m> that converge to <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The boundary of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is the set of boundary points of <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>A</m> contains all of its limit points.
          Similarly, <m>A</m> is closed if and only if <m>A</m> contains all of its boundary points.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set of all limit points of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is denoted by <m>A'</m>.
          The closure of <m>A</m> is the set <m>\overline{A} = A \cup A'</m>.
          The closure of <m>A</m> is the smallest closed set in <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if
          <m>\lim a_n</m> is in <m>A</m> whenever <m>(a_n)</m> is a convergent sequence in <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
