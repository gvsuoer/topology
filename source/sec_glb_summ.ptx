          A lower bound or a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R</m> that is bounded below is a real number <m>m</m> such that
          <m>m \leq s</m> for all <m>s \in S</m>.
          A greatest lower bound
          (or infimum)
          for a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R</m> that is bounded below is a real number <m>m</m> such that

              <p>
                if <m>k</m> is a lower bound for <m>S</m>, then <m>m \geq k</m>.

          An upper bound for a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R</m> that is bounded above is a real number <m>M</m> such that
          <m>M \geq s</m> for all <m>s \in S</m>.
          A least upper bound
          (or supremum)
          for a nonempty subset <m>S</m> of <m>\R</m> that is bounded above is a real number <m>M</m> such that
          <ol marker="i">
            <li>
              <p>
                <m>M</m> is an upper bound for <m>S</m> and

            <li>
              <p>
                if <m>k</m> is an upper bound for <m>s</m>, then <m>M \leq k</m>.

      <li>
        <p>
          The distance from a point <m>x</m> to a set <m>A</m> in a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is <m>d(x,A) = \inf \{d(x,a) \mid a \in A\}</m>.
          There may be no point <m>a \in A</m> such that <m>d(x,A) = d(x,a)</m>,
          so it is necessary to use an infimum to define this distance.
