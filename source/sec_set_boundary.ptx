  <title>The Boundary of a Set</title>
  <p>
    In addition to limit points, we also defined boundary points in metric spaces.
    Recall that a boundary point of a set <m>A</m> in a metric space <m>X</m> could be considered to be any point in <m>\overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}</m>.
    We make the same definition in a topological space.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>boundary point in a topological space</h></idx>
  <idx><h>boundary in a topological space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space,
        and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
        A <term>boundary point</term> of <m>A</m> is a point <m>x \in X</m> such that every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> and a point in <m>X \setminus A</m>.
        The <term>boundary</term> of <m>A</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Bdry(A) = \{x \in X \mid x \text{ is a boundary point of }  A\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    As with metric spaces,
    the boundary points of a set <m>A</m> are those points that are
    <q>between</q>
    <m>A</m> and its complement.

  <p>
    Just as with metric spaces,
    we can characterize the closed sets as the sets that contain their boundary.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_TS_Closed_boundary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>C</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C</m> contains its boundary.
      </p>
    </statement>
