        We can use greatest lower bounds to prove the following theorem.
        <theorem>
          <statement>

              Given any two distinct real numbers <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>,

        This theorem tells us an important fact <mdash/> that the rational numbers are what is called <term>dense</term>
        in the set of real numbers.
        We prove this theorem in this exercise.
        Let <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> be real numbers and assume <m>x \lt  y</m>.
        By the Archimedean property of the natural numbers
        (see <xref ref="ex_GLB_Archimedean">Exercises</xref>
        and <xref ref="ex_GLB_Archimedean_2"></xref>),
        there is a positive integer <m>n</m> such that <m>n(y-x) > 1</m>.
        Let <m>S = \{k \in \Z \mid k > nx \}</m>.

              <m>q \in \Z</m> with <m>q \lt m</m>, then <m>q \leq nx</m>.
              It may be helpful to use the Well-Ordering Principle that states Every subset of the integers that is bounded below contains its infimum.
              (The Well-Ordering Principle is one of many axioms that are equivalent to the Principle of Mathematical Induction.
              These principles are taken as axioms and are assumed to be true.)

        For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true.
        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
        If a statement is true, explain why.
