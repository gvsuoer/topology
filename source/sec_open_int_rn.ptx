  <title>Open Intervals and <m>\R</m></title>
  <p>
    If we think of a homeomorphism as allowing us to stretch or bend a space,
    it is reasonable to think that we could stretch an open interval of the form <m>(a,b)</m> infinitely in both directions without altering the nature of the open sets.
    That is, we should expect that <m>\R</m> with the standard topology is homeomorphic to <m>(a,b)</m> with the subspace topology.

      Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be real numbers with <m>a \lt  b</m>.
      To show that <m>(\R, d_E)</m> is homeomorphic to <m>(a,b)</m>,
      we need a continuous bijection from <m>\R</m> to <m>(a,b)</m> whose inverse is also continuous.

            First we demonstrate that <m>(0,1)</m> and <m>\R</m> are homeomorphic using the Euclidean metric topology.
            Let <m>f : (0,1) \to \R</m> be defined by
            <me>
              f(x) = \tan\left(\pi\left(x-\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)
            </me>.

            The result of (a) is that <m>\R</m> and <m>(0,1)</m> are homeomorphic spaces.
            To complete the argument that <m>\R</m> is homeomorphic to <m>(a,b)</m>,
            define a function <m>g: (0,1) \to (a,b)</m> and explain why your <m>g</m> is a homeomorphism.

    It is left to <xref ref="ex_R_intervals"/> to show that <m>\R</m> is also homeomorphic to any interval of the form
    <m>(a,\infty)</m> or <m>(-\infty,b)</m>.
    Later we will determine if <m>\R</m> is homeomorphic to intervals of the form <m>[a,b)</m>,
    <m>(a,b]</m>, <m>[a, \infty)</m> or <m>(-\infty, b]</m>.
