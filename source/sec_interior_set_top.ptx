  <title>The Interior of a Set in a Topological Space</title>
  <p>
    We have seen that topologies define the open sets in a topological space.
    As in metric spaces,
    open sets can be characterized in terms of their interior points.
    We defined interior points in metric spaces in terms of neighborhoods <mdash/> the same holds true in topological spaces.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m> be a subset of a topological space <m>X</m>.
        A point <m>a \in A</m> is an interior point
            <idx><h>interior point</h></idx>
        of <m>A</m> if <m>A</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Remember that a set is a neighborhood of a point if the set contains an open set that contains the point.
    By definition,
    every open set is a neighborhood of each of its points,
    so every point of an open set <m>O</m> is an interior point of <m>O</m>.
    Conversely, if every point of a set <m>O</m> is an interior point,
    then <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and is open.
    This argument is summarized in the next theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.
        A subset <m>O</m> of <m>X</m> is open if and only if every point of <m>O</m> is an interior point of <m>O</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The collection of interior points in a set form a subset of that set,
    called the <term>interior</term> of the set.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The interior of a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Int(A) = \{a \in A \mid a \text{ is an interior point of }  A\}
        </me>.

    One might expect that the interior of a set is an open set,
    as it was in metric spaces.
    This is true, but we can say even more.
    In <xref ref="act_interior"/>
    we saw that in our examples that <m>\Int(A)</m> was the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>.
    That this is always true is the subject of the next theorem.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Interior">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a topological space,
        and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
        The interior of <m>A</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      We need to prove that <m>\Int(A)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m>,
      and that <m>\Int(A)</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>.
      First we demonstrate that <m>\Int(A)</m> is an open set.
      Let <m>a \in \Int(A)</m>.
      Then <m>a</m> is an interior point of <m>A</m>,
      so <m>A</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
      This implies that there exists an open set <m>O</m> containing <m>a</m> so that <m>O \subseteq A</m>.
      But <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points,
      so every point in <m>O</m> is an interior point of <m>A</m>.
      It follows that <m>O \subseteq \Int(A)</m>.
      Thus, <m>\Int(A)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and,
      consequently, <m>\Int(A)</m> is an open set.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof that <m>\Int(A)</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m> is left for the next activity.

      Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a topological space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            What will we have to show to prove that <m>\Int(A)</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose that <m>O</m> is an open subset of <m>X</m> that is contained in <m>A</m>,
            and let <m>x \in O</m>.
            What does the fact that <m>O</m> is open tell us?
            Then complete the proof that <m>O \subseteq \Int(A)</m>.

    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_Interior">Theorem</xref> is the following.

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>O</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is open if and only if <m>O = \Int(O)</m>.
