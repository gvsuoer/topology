  <title>Connected Subsets of <m>\R</m></title>
  <p>
    With <xref ref="thm_conn_subset">Theorem</xref> in hand,
    we are just about ready to show that any interval in <m>\R</m> is connected.
    Let us return for a moment to our example of <m>A = (-1,0) \cup (4,5)</m> in <m>\R</m>.
    It is not difficult to see that if <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> are a separation of <m>A</m>,
    then the subset <m>(-1,0)</m> must be entirely contained in either <m>U</m> or in <m>V</m>.
    The reason for this is that <m>(-1,0)</m> is a connected subset of <m>A</m>.
    This result is true in general.

      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      Assume that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> form a separation of <m>A</m>.
      Let <m>C</m> be a connected subset of <m>A</m>.
      In this activity we want to prove that
      <m>C \subseteq U</m> or <m>C \subseteq V</m>.

            Use the fact that <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> form a separation to <m>A</m> to wxplain why
            <m>C \subseteq U \cup V</m> and <m>C \cap U \cap V = \emptyset</m>.

            Given that <m>C</m> is connected,

    Now we can prove that any interval in <m>\R</m> is connected.
    Since <m>[a,b]</m>, <m>[a,b)</m>,
    and <m>(a,b]</m> are all sets that lie between <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>\overline{(a,b)}</m>,
    we can address their connectedness all at once with the next result.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_connected_limitpoints">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and <m>C</m> a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
        If <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>X</m> and <m>C \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{C}</m>,
        then <m>A</m> is connected in <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and <m>C</m> a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
      Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m> such that <m>C \subseteq A \subseteq \overline{C}</m>.
      To show that <m>A</m> is connected,
      assume to the contrary that <m>A</m> is disconnected.
      Then there are nonempty open subsets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>X</m> that form a separation of <m>A</m>.
      <xref ref="lem_separation_subset">Lemma</xref>
      shows that <m>C \subseteq U</m> or <m>C \subseteq V</m>.
      Without loss of generality we assume that <m>C \subseteq U</m>.
      Since <m>U \cap V \cap A = \emptyset</m>, it follows that
      <me>
        C \cap V = (C \cap A) \cap V = C \cap (A \cap V)  \subseteq U \cap A \cap V = \emptyset
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>A \cap V \neq \emptyset</m>,
      there is an element <m>x \in A \cap V</m>.
      Since <m>x \notin C</m> and <m>x \in A \subseteq \overline{C}</m>,
      it must be the case that <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>C</m>.
      Since <m>V</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m>,
      it follows that <m>V \cap C \neq \emptyset</m>.
      This contradiction allows us to conclude that <m>A</m> is connected.
    </p>
  </proof>

    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_connected_limitpoints">Theorem</xref>
    is that any interval of the form <m>[a,b)</m>,
    <m>(a,b]</m>, <m>[a,b]</m>,
    <m>(-\infty,
    b]</m>, or <m>[a, \infty)</m> in <m>\R</m> is connected.
    This prompts the question,
    are there any other subsets of <m>\R</m> that are connected?

            Now suppose that <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>\R</m> that contains two or more points.
            Assume that <m>A</m> is not an interval.
            Then there must exist points <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> in <m>A</m> and a point <m>c</m> in
            <m>\R \setminus A</m> between <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>.
            Use this idea to find a separation of <m>A</m>.
            What can we conclude about <m>A</m>?
