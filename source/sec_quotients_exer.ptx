        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and let <m>A</m> be a subspace of <m>X</m>.
        Define a relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> whose equivalence classes are <m>A</m> and <m>\{x\}</m> if <m>x \notin A</m>.
        In this case the quotient space is denoted as <m>X/A</m>
        (think of this space as obtained by crushing <m>A</m> to a point and leaving everything else alone).
        Describe each of the following quotient spaces.

              Are the spaces <m>(Y, \tau_p)</m> and <m>(Y, \tau_q)</m> homeomorphic?

      That the particular point and excluded point topologies are topologies is the subject of Exercises <xref ref="ex_particular_point_topology"/> and <xref ref="ex_excluded_point_topology"/> on <xref ref="ex_particular_point_topology">page</xref>.
      Let <m>\sim</m> be the equivalence relation on <m>\Z</m> defined by

        In the process of developing techniques of drawing in perspective,
        renaissance artists found it necessary to consider a point at infinity where all lines intersect.
        This creates a geometry that extends the concept of the real plane.
        This new geometry is the real projective plane <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m>,
          <idx><h>real projective plane</h></idx>
        which can be thought of as the quotient space of
        <m>\R^3 \setminus \{(0,0,0)\}</m> with the relation <m>\sim_P</m> such that <m>(x_1,x_2,x_3) \sim_P (y_1,y_2,y_3)</m> in
        <m>\R^3 \setminus \{(0,0,0)\}</m> if and only if there is a nonzero real number <m>k</m> such that <m>y_1 = kx_1</m>,
        <m>y_2 = kx_2</m>, and <m>y_3 = kx_3</m>.
        In the projective plane,
        parallel lines intersect at a point at infinity,
        just as they seem to with our human vision.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Show that <m>\sim_P</m> is an equivalence relation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Give a geometric description of the elements in the quotient space <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There are other ways to visualize <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m>.
              For example, explain why the real projective plane
              <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m> is homeomorphic to the quotient space
              <m>S^2/\ssim</m> of <m>S^2 = \{(x,y,z) \in \R^3 \mid x^2+y^2+z^2 = 1\}</m>,
              where <m>\sim</m> identifies antipodal points on <m>S^2</m>.
              No formal proofs are necessary,
              but a convincing explanation is in order.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since we identify antipodal points on <m>S^2</m> in the space <m>S^2/\sim</m>,
              we can think of this space in another way.
              If <m>P</m> is a point on <m>S^2</m> not on the equator,
              then its antipodal point is also not on the equator.
              So we can think of <m>S^2/\ssim</m> as the top hemisphere,
              along with the equator on which antipodal points are identified,
              as illustrated at left in <xref ref="F_projective_1">Figure</xref>.
              <figure xml:id="F_projective_1">
                <caption>Three perspectives of <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m>.</caption>
                <image width="73%" source="projective_1.png"/> <image width="73%" source="Projective_disk.eps"/> <image width="73%" source="Projective_square.eps"/>
              </figure>
              By projecting the points on the hemisphere down to the <m>xy</m>-plane,
              we can represent <m>S^2/\ssim</m> as a disk whose antipodal points are identified,
              as seen in the middle in <xref ref="F_projective_1">Figure</xref>.
              Use this last perspective to explain why
              <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m> can be realized as a square where opposite sides are identified in opposite directions as shown at right in <xref ref="F_projective_1">Figure</xref>.

            <p>
              The projective plane <m>\mathbb{R}P^2</m> is a complicated object <mdash/> it cannot be embedded in <m>\R^3</m> and so it is not something that can be easily visualized.
              The projective plane is a non-orientable surface and is also important in classifying surfaces <mdash/> basically,
              every closed surface is made up of spheres,
              tori, and/or projective planes.
              In this part of the exercise we see how the projective plane itself is made by adjoining a M&#xf6;bius strip to a disk
              (think of sewing the boundary of M&#xf6;bius strip to the perimeter of a disk).

        Let <m>(X,\tau)</m> be a topological space.
        A subspace <m>A</m> of <m>X</m> is a <em>retract</em>
          <idx><h>retract</h></idx>
        of <m>X</m>
        (or that <m>X</m> retracts onto <m>A</m>)

        Such a map <m>r</m> is called a <em>retraction</em>.

      Intuitively,
        a subspace <m>A</m> of <m>X</m> is a retract of <m>X</m> if we can continually collapse

        <m>X</m> onto <m>A</m> without moving any of the points in <m>A</m>.
        Certain types of retracts,

        For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true.
        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
        If a statement is true, explain why.
