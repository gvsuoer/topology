  <title>Quotient Spaces</title>
  <p>
    As we saw in our preview activity,
    if we have a surjection <m>p</m> from a topological space <m>(X,\tau)</m> to a set <m>Y</m>,
    we were able to define a topology on <m>Y</m> by making the open sets the sets
    <m>U \subseteq Y</m> such that <m>p^{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
    This is how we will create what is called the
    <term>quotient topology</term>.
    Before we can define the quotient topology,
    we need to know that this construction always makes a topology.

    Another perspective of the quotient topology utilizes the fact that any equivalence relation on a set <m>X</m> partitions <m>X</m> into a union of disjoint equivalence classes <m>[x] = \{y \in X \mid y \sim x\}</m>.
    There is a natural surjection <m>q</m> from <m>X</m> to the space of equivalence classes given by <m>q(x) = [x]</m>.
    We investigate this perspective in the next activity.

      Let <m>X = \{a,b,c,d,e,f\}</m> and let <m>\tau = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, b, c\}, \{a, b, c, d\}, X\}</m>.
      Then <m>(X, \tau)</m> is a topological space.
      Let <m>A = \{a, b, c\}</m> and <m>B = \{d,e,f\}</m>.
      Define a relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> such that
      <m>x \sim y</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both in <m>A</m> or both in <m>B</m>.
      Assume that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation.
      The sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are the equivalence classes for this relation.
      That is <m>A = [a] = [b] = [c]</m> and <m>B = [d] = [e] = [f]</m>.
      Let <m>X^* = \{A,B\}</m>.
      Then we can define <m>p : X \to X^*</m> by sending <m>x \in X</m> to the set to which it belongs.
      That is, <m>p(x) = [x]</m> for <m>x \in X</m>, or
      <me>
        p(a) = A, p(b) = A, p(c) = A, p(d) = B, p(e) = B, \text{ and }  p(f) = B

  <p>
    The partition of <m>X</m> in <xref ref="act_quotient_er"/>
    into the disjoint union of sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> defines an equivalence relation on <m>X</m> where
    <m>x \sim y</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are both in the same set <m>A</m> or <m>B</m>.
    That is, <m>a \sim b \sim c</m> and <m>d \sim e \sim f</m>.
    In this context,
    the sets <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are equivalence classes <mdash/> <m>A = [a]</m> and <m>B = [d]</m>,
    where <m>[x]</m> is the equivalence class of <m>x</m>.
    This leads to a general construction.
  </p>
  <p>
    If <m>(X, \tau)</m> is a topological space and <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation on <m>X</m>,
    we can let <m>X/\ssim</m> be the set of distinct equivalence classes of <m>X</m> under <m>\sim</m>.
    Then <m>p: X \to X/\ssim</m> defined by
    <m>p(x) = [x]</m> is a surjection and <m>X/\ssim</m> has the quotient topology.
    The space <m>X/\ssim</m> is called a
    <term>quotient space</term>.
        <idx><h>quotient space</h></idx>
    The space <m>X/\ssim</m> is also called an
    <term>identification</term> space
        <idx><h>identification space</h></idx>
    because the equivalence relation identifies points in the set to be thought of as the same.
    This allows us to visualize quotient spaces as resulting from gluing or collapsing parts of the space <m>X</m>.

  <example>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>I = [0,1]</m> and let
        <m>X = I \times I</m> with standard topology.
        Define a relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m> by <m>(x,y) \sim (x,y)</m> if
        <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m> and <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m>,
        <m>(x,0) \sim (x,1)</m> if <m>0 \leq x \leq 1</m>.
        It is straightforward to show that <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation.
        Let us consider what the identification space <m>X/\ssim</m> looks like.
        The space <m>I \times I</m> is the unit square as shown in <xref ref="F_Quotient_tube"/>.
        All points in the interior of the square are identified only with themselves.
        However, the top side and bottom side are identified with each other in the same direction.
        Think of <m>X</m> as a piece of paper.
        We roll up the sides of the square to make the top and bottom sides coincide.
        The result is that <m>X/\ssim</m> is the cylinder as shown in <xref ref="F_Quotient_tube"/>.

    Many other interesting identification spaces can be made.
    For example,
    let <m>X = I \times I</m> and define <m>\sim</m> by <m>(x, y) \sim (x,y)</m> if
    <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m> and <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m>,
    <m>(0, y) \sim (1, y)</m> for <m>0 \lt y \lt 1</m>,
    <m>(x,0) \sim (1-x,1)</m> for <m>0 \lt x \lt 1</m>.
    This identification is illustrated in <xref ref="F_Klein_bottle"/>.
    The resulting identification space <m>X/\ssim</m> is a Klein bottle.
    A nice illustration of this can be seen at \url{https://plus.maths.org/content/introducing-klein-bottle}.
