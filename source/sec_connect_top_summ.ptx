  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A topological space <m>(X,\tau)</m> is <term>connected</term>
          <idx><h>connected space</h></idx>
        if <m>X</m> cannot be written as the union of two disjoint,
        nonempty,
        open subsets.
        A subset <m>A</m> of a topological space topological space
        <m>(X,\tau)</m> is connected if <m>A</m> is connected in the subspace topology.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A separation of a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is a pair of nonempty open subsets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> of <m>X</m> such that
     
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>A \subseteq (U \cup V)</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>U \cap A \neq \emptyset</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>V \cap A \neq \emptyset</m>, and
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>U \cap V \cap A = \emptyset</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Showing that a set has a separation can be a convenient way to show that the set is disconnected.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        The connected subsets of <m>\R</m> are the intervals and the single point sets.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A subspace <m>C</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is a connected component of <m>X</m> if <m>C</m> is connected and there is no larger connected subspace of <m>X</m> that contains <m>C</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        One application of connectedness is the Intermediate Value Theorem that tells us that if <m>A</m> is a connected subset of a topological space <m>X</m> and if
        <m>f : A \to \R</m> is a continuous function,
        then for any <m>a,b \in A</m> and any
        <m>y \in \R</m> between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>,
        there is a point <m>x \in A</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A subset <m>S</m> of a connected topological space <m>X</m> is a cut set of <m>X</m> if the set <m>X \setminus S</m> is disconnected,
        while a .point <m>p</m> in <m>X</m> is a cut point if <m>X \setminus \{p\}</m> is disconnected.
        The property of being a cut set or a cut point is a topological invariant,
        so we can sometimes use cut sets and cut points to show that topological spaces are not homeomorphic.
