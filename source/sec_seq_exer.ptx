        Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space,
        let <m>x \in X</m>, and let <m>A</m> be a nonempty subset of <m>X</m>.
        Recall that the distance from <m>x</m> to <m>A</m> is
        <me>
          d(x,A) = \inf \{d(x,a) \mid a \in A

        In this exercise we see how we can view the distance between a point and a set in terms of sequences.
        Let <m>m = d(x,A)</m>.
        We will show that there must be a sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>A</m> so that <m>d(x,A) = \lim d(x,a_n)</m>.

              Let <m>a_n \in B_n \cap A</m> for each <m>n</m>.
              What property does this sequence have?
              Explain how we have just proved the following theorem.

        Let <m>X</m> be the set of real valued functions on the interval <m>[0,1]</m> and let <m>d</m> be the metric on <m>X</m> defined by

          d(f,g) = \sup\{|f(x)-g(x)| \mid x \in [0,1]\}

        (See <xref ref="ex_GLB_function_sup_metric"/>
        on <xref ref="ex_GLB_function_sup_metric">page</xref>.)  There is a difference between the point-wise convergence of a sequence of functions and convergence in the metric space <m>(X,d)</m> that we explore in this exercise.
        For each <m>n \in \Z^+</m>,

              Since the sequence <m>(1)</m> converges to <m>1</m>,
              if we look at the behavior at each point,
              we might think that the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> converges to the function <m>f</m> defined by

              Suppose now we consider the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> as a sequence of functions in <m>C[0,1]</m>,
              the space of continuous functions from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>,

              (Refer to <xref ref="act_MS_metrics"/>.) The function in <xref ref="eq_0_1_function"/> is not a continuous function,
              so can't be a limit of the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> in <m>C[01]</m>.
              Determine if the sequence <m>(f_n)</m> has a limit in <m>C[0,1]</m>.
              If so, what is the limit?
              If not, verify that the sequence has no limit.
