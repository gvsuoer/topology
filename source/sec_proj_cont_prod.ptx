  <title>Projections and Continuous Functions on Products</title>
  <p>
    Given topological spaces <m>(X_1, \tau_1)</m> and <m>(X_2, \tau_2)</m>,
    we define <m>\pi_1: X_1 \times X_2 \to X_1</m> and <m>\pi_2: X_1 \times X_2 \to X_2</m> by
    <m>\pi_1((x,y)) = x</m> and <m>\pi_2((x,y)) = y</m>.
    These functions <m>\pi_1</m> and <m>\pi_2</m> are the <term>projections</term>
        <idx><h>projection functions</h></idx>
    of <m>X_1 \times X_2</m> onto <m>X_1</m> and <m>X_2</m>,
    respectively.
    These projection functions can help us determine when a function <m>f</m> from a topological space <m>Y</m> to <m>X_1 \times X_2</m> is continuous.

      Let <m>(X_1, \tau_1)</m> and
      <m>(X_2, \tau_2)</m> be topological spaces and let <m>O_1</m> be an open set in <m>X_1</m>.

        <li>
          <p>
            Determine which set is <m>\pi_1^{-1}(O_1)</m>.

  <p>
    The same argument as in <xref ref="act_projection_continuous"/>
    shows that <m>\pi_2</m> is also a continuous function.
    In general, if <m>X = \Pi_{i=1}^n X_{i}</m> is a finite product of topological spaces,
    then the projection <m>\pi_{k}: X \to X_{k}</m> is a continuous function for each <m>k</m>,
    where <m>\pi_k((x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n)) = x_k</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>O = \Pi_{i=1}^n O_i</m> be a basic open set in <m>X = \Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m>,
    where <m>X_i</m> is a topological space for each <m>i</m>.
    We can extend the result of <xref ref="act_projection_continuous"/> to see that
    <me>
      \pi_i^{-1}(O_i) = X_1 \times X_2 \times \cdots \times X_{i-1} \times O_i \times X_{i+1} \times \cdots \times X_n
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So
    <me>
      \Pi_{i=1}^n O_i = \bigcap_{i=1}^n \pi_i^{-1}(O_i)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    So each basic open set is a finite intersection of sets of the form
    <m>\pi_i^{-1}(O_i)</m> where <m>O_i</m> is open in <m>X_i</m>.
    When this happens,
    we call the collection of sets of the form <m>\pi_i^{-1}(O_i)</m> a
    <term>subbasis</term> of the topology.
  </p>
  <definition xml:id="def_subbasis">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space.
        A subset <m>\CS</m> of <m>\tau</m> is a subbasis
            <idx><h>subbasis</h></idx>
        or subbase
            <idx><h>subbase</h></idx>
        for <m>\tau</m> if the set of all finite intersections of elements of <m>\CS</m> is a basis for <m>\tau</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As an example,
    since finite intersections of intervals of the form <m>(-\infty,b)</m> and
    <m>(a, \infty)</m> give all intervals of the form <m>(a,b)</m>,
    the collection <m>\CS = \{(-\infty,b), (a, \infty) \mid a, b \in \R\}</m> is a subbasis for the standard topology on <m>\R</m>.
    Note that this collection itself is not a basis for the standard topology on <m>\R</m>.
    If <m>X = \Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m> is a product of topological space,
    then another example of a subbasis is the collection
    <me>
      \CS = \bigcup_{i=1}^n \{\pi_i^{-1}(O_i) \mid O_i \text{ is open in }  X_i\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    This set is a subbasis for the product topology on <m>X</m>
    (the verification of this is left to <xref ref="ex_subbasis"/>).
  </p>
  <p>
    We note here that there is another topology,
    called the <term>product topology</term>
        <idx><h>product topology</h></idx>
    ) on <m>X</m> with subbasis <m>S = \bigcup S_{\alpha \in I} S_{\alpha}</m>, where
    <me>
      S_{\alpha} = \{\pi_{\alpha}^{-1}(U_{\alpha}) \mid U_{\alpha} \text{ is open in }  X_{\alpha}\}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    For reasons we won't go into,
    the product topology is preferred to the box topology for infinite products
    (many important theorems that hold for finite products will not hold for infinite products using the box topology,
    but will hold using the product topology).
    However, the product topology and the box topology are the same for finite products,
    and since we won't consider infinite products here we will not worry about the distinction.
    For our purposes we will use the terms
    <q>box topology</q>
    and
    <q>product topology</q>
    interchangeably.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we have discussed before,
    it can often be easier to define a topology using a basis or subbasis than it is to describe all of the sets in the topology.
    As we might expect,
    since the continuity of a function can be determined by the inverse image of basis elements,
    the continuity of a function can also be determined by the inverse image of subbasis elements.

      Prove <xref ref="thm_subbasis_continuous">Theorem</xref>. (Hint: Recall that <m>f</m> is continuous if
      <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open in <m>X</m> for each basic open set <m>B</m>.)
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_subbasis_continuous">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> and
          <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m> be topological spaces,
          let <m>\CS</m> be a subbasis for <m>\tau_Y</m>,
          and let <m>f: X \to Y</m> be a function.
          If <m>f^{-1}(S)</m> is open in <m>X</m> for each <m>S \in \CS</m>,
          then <m>f</m> is continuous.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
  </activity>
  <p>
    Now suppose that <m>X_1</m>, <m>X_2</m>,
    and <m>Y</m> are topological spaces,
    and that <m>f: Y \to X_1 \times X_2</m> is a function.
    Then <m>\pi_1 \circ f</m> maps <m>Y</m> to <m>X_1</m> and
    <m>\pi_2 \circ f</m> maps <m>Y</m> to <m>X_2</m>.
    Since the composition of continuous functions is continuous,
    we can see that if <m>f</m> is continuous so are
    <m>\pi_1\circ f</m> and <m>\pi_2 \circ f</m>.
    To determine if <m>f</m> is a continuous function,
    it would be useful to know if the converse is true.
    A key idea in the proof is the result of <xref ref="ex_inverse_composite_sets"/> on <xref ref="ex_inverse_composite_sets">page</xref> that if <m>R</m>,
    <m>S</m>,
    and <m>T</m> are sets, and
    <m>g: R \to S</m> and <m>h : S \to T</m> are functions,
    then <m>(h \circ g)^{-1}(O) = g^{-1}(h^{-1}(O)</m> for any subset <m>O</m> of <m>T</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we can use projections to determine when functions to product spaces are continuous.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_prod_continuity">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X_i</m> for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces,
        and let <m>f: Y \to \Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m> be a function.
        Then <m>f</m> is continuous if and only if
        <m>\pi_i \circ f</m> is continuous for each <m>i</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X_i</m> for <m>i</m> from <m>1</m> to <m>n</m> and <m>Y</m> be topological spaces,
      and let <m>f: Y \to \Pi X_i</m> be a function.
      If <m>f</m> is continuous,
      the facts that each <m>\pi_i</m> is continuous and that composites of continuous functions are continuous show that
      <m>\pi_i \circ f</m> is continuous for each <m>i</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now suppose that <m>\pi_i \circ f</m> is continuous for each <m>i</m>.
      Recall that
      <me>
        \CS = \{\pi_i^{-1}(O_i) \mid O_i \text{ is open in }  X_i\}
      </me>
      is a subbasis for the product topology on <m>\Pi_{i=1}^n X_i</m>.
      To prove that <m>f</m> is continuous,
      <xref ref="thm_subbasis_continuous">Theorem</xref>
      tells us that it is enough to show that
      <m>f^{-1}(S)</m> is open for each <m>S</m> in <m>\CS</m>.
      Let <m>O_i</m> be an open set in <m>X_i</m>.
      <xref ref="ex_inverse_composite_sets"/> on <xref ref="ex_inverse_composite_sets">page</xref> tells us that
      <me>
        f^{-1}(\pi_i^{-1}(O_i)) = (\pi_i \circ f)^{-1}(O_i)
      </me>,
      which is open in <m>Y</m> because <m>\pi_i \circ f</m> is continuous.
      Therefore, <m>f</m> is continuous.
