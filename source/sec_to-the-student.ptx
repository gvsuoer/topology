  <title>To the Student</title>
  <p>
    I have endeavored to keep the prerequisite material to a minimum for this text.
    The first two sections discuss sets and functions.
    Most of this material should be review for the reader,
    but the importance of these ideas in the subsequent sections makes it a good idea to spend time on these sections.
    That being said,
    it will be very helpful for the reader to have some background in reading and writing mathematical proofs.

    The objectives of this book and its inquiry-based format place the responsibility of learning the material where it belongs <mdash/> on your shoulders.
    It is imperative that you engage in the material by completing the preview activities and the in-class activities in order to develop your intuition and understanding of the material.
    If you do this, and ask questions when you have them,
    your probability of success will be greatly enhanced.
    Good luck!
