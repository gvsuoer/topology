  <title>Topological Equivalence</title>
  <p>
    When we can deform one set into another without poking holes in the set,
    we consider the two sets to be equivalent from a topological perspective.
    Such a deformation <m>f</m> has to be a bijection to ensure that the two sets contain the same number of elements,
    continuous so that the inverse images of open sets are open,
    and <m>f^{-1}</m> must be continuous so images of open sets are open.
    Such a function provides a one-to-one correspondence between open sets in the two spaces.
    This leads to the next definition.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Two topological spaces <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> are topologically equivalent if there is a continuous bijection
        <m>f : X \to Y</m> such that <m>f^{-1}</m> is also continuous.
      </p>
    </statement>

  <p>
    Metric equivalence always implies topological equivalence
    (using the metric topologies),
    which is left for <xref ref="ex_me_implies_te"/>.
    So metric equivalence is a stronger condition than topological equivalence.
  </p>

  <p>
    The function <m>f</m>
    (or <m>f^{-1}</m>)
    in <xref ref="def_MS_topological_equivalence"/>
    is called a <term>homeomorphism</term>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_Homeomorphism">
  <idx><h>homeomorphism</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X,\tau_X)</m> and <m>(Y,\tau_Y)</m> be topological spaces.
        A function <m>f: X \to Y</m> is a homeomorphism
        if <m>f</m> is a continuous bijection such that <m>f^{-1}</m> is also continuous.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    <idx><h>homeomorphic spaces</h></idx>
    If there is a homeomorphism from <m>(X,\tau_X)</m> to
    <m>(Y,\tau_Y)</m> we say that the spaces <m>(X,\tau_X)</m> to
    <m>(Y,\tau_Y)</m> are <term>homeomorphic</term>
    topological spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    It can be difficult to show directly that two metric spaces are homeomorphic,
    but there are ways to make the process easier in metric spaces.
    If <m>f</m> is a homeomorphism from the metric space
    <m>(\R^2, d_E)</m> to the metric space <m>(\R^2, d_M)</m>,
    the continuity of <m>f</m> ensures a smooth deformation from <m>\R^2</m> to <m>\R^2</m>.
    In terms of the metrics,
    this means that distances cannot get distorted too much <mdash/> in fact,
    the amount distances are distorted should be bounded.
    In other words,
    we might expect that there is a constant <m>K</m> so that
    <m>d_E(x,y) \leq K d_M(f(x),
    f(y))</m> for any <m>x, y \in \R^2</m>.
    The next theorem tells us that this is a sufficient condition for topological equivalence when we work in the same underlying space.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a set on which two metrics <m>d</m> and <m>d'</m> are defined.
        If there exist positive constants <m>K</m> and <m>K'</m> so that
        <md>
          <mrow>d'(x,y) \amp \leq K d(x,y)</mrow>
          <mrow>d(x,y) \amp \leq K' d'(x,y)</mrow>
        </md>
        for all <m>x,y \in X</m>,
        then <m>(X,d)</m> is topologically equivalent to <m>(X,d')</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a set on which two metrics <m>d</m> and <m>d'</m> are defined.
      Suppose there exist positive constants <m>K</m> and <m>K'</m> so that
      <md>
        <mrow>d'(x,y) \amp \leq K d(x,y)</mrow>
        <mrow>d(x,y) \amp \leq K' d'(x,y)</mrow>
      </md>
      for all <m>x,y \in X</m>.
      Let <m>i_X : (X,d) \to (X,d')</m> be the identity mapping.
      That is, <m>i_X(x)=x</m> for all <m>x \in X</m>.
      We will prove that <m>i_X</m> is a homeomorphism.
      We know that <m>i_X</m> is a bijection,
      so we only need verify that <m>i_X</m> and <m>i_X^{-1}</m> are continuous.
      Let <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m> be given, and let <m>a \in X</m>.
      Let <m>\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{K}</m>.
      Suppose <m>x \in X</m> so that <m>d(x,a) \lt  \delta</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        d'(i_X(x), i_X(a)) = d'(x,a) \leq Kd(x,a) \lt  K\delta = K\left(\frac{\epsilon}{K}\right) = \epsilon
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <m>i_X</m> is continuous.
      The same argument shows that <m>i_X^{-1}</m> is also continuous.
      Therefore, <m>i_X</m> is a homeomorphism between <m>(X,d)</m> and <m>(X,d')</m>.
