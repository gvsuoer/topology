      <p>
        Consider the Double Origin topology<idx><h>topology</h><h>Double Origin</h></idx> defined as follows.
        Let <m>X = \R^2 \cup \{0^*\}</m>,
        where <m>0^*</m> is considered as a point that is not in <m>\R^2</m>
        (<m>0^*</m> is our double origin).
        As a basis for the open sets,
        we use the standard open balls for every point except <m>0</m> and <m>0^*</m>.
        For the point <m>0</m>, we define open sets to be
        <me>
          N(0,r) = \left\{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid x^2+y^2 \lt  \frac{1}{r^2}, y \gt 0\right\}  \cup \{0\}
        </me>
        and for <m>0^*</m> we define open sets to be
        <me>
          N(0^*, r) =  \left\{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid x^2+y^2 \lt  \frac{1}{r^2}, y \lt  0\right\}  \cup \{0^*\}
        </me>.
        So <m>N(0,r)</m> is the top half of a disk of radius
