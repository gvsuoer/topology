        Let <m>X = \{1,3,5\}</m> and define

        Recall from <xref ref="sec_metric_spaces"/>
        that we can construct a finite metric space by starting with a finite set of points and making a graph with the points as vertices.
        We construct edges so that the graph is connected
        (that is, there is a path from any one vertex to any other)
        and give weights to the edges.
        We then define a metric <m>d</m> on <m>S</m> by letting <m>d(x,y)</m> be the length of a shortest path between vertices <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the graph.
        Consider the metric space <m>(X,d)</m> corresponding to the graph in <xref ref="F_Graph_metric_ex"/>.
