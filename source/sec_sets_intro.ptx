  <title>Introduction</title>
  <p>
    At its most basic level topology deals with sets and how we can deform sets into other sets. So to start our study of topology, we begin with sets. Much of this material should be familiar, but some might be new. The first issue for us to settle on is as precise a definition of <q>set</q> as possible.

    <p>
      Suppose we try to define a set to be a collection of elements.
      So, by definition, the elements are the objects contained in the set.
      We use the symbol <m>\in</m> to denote that an object is an element of a set.
      So <m>\notin</m> means an object is not in the set <mdash/> if <m>x</m> is an object in a set <m>S</m> we write <m>x \in S</m>,
      and if <m>x</m> is not an object in a set <m>S</m> we write <m>x \notin S</m>.
      We write sets using set brackets.
      For example,
      the set <m>\{a,b,c\}</m> is the set whose elements are the symbols <m>a</m>,
      <m>b</m>,
      and <m>c</m>.
      We can also include in the set notation conditions on elements of the set.
      For example,
      <m>\{x \in \R : x \gt 0\}</m> is the set of positive real numbers.
      We typically use capital letters to denote sets.
      Some familiar examples of sets are <m>\R</m>, the set of real numbers;
      <m>\Q</m>, the set of rational numbers;
      and <m>\Z</m>, the set of integers.
      Sets can also contain sets as elements.
      For example,
      the power set of a set <m>S</m> is the set of subsets of <m>S</m>.
      So the power set of <m>S = \{1,2\}</m> is the set
      <m>\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}</m>. (We will define subsets and the empty set later in this activity).

            Consider the following
            <q>set</q>
            <m>S</m>, which is a collection of objects:
            <me>
              S = \{A \text{ is a set }  \mid A \notin A\}
            </me>.
            That is, <m>S</m> is the collection of sets that do not have themselves as elements.
            Given any object <m>x</m>, either <m>x \in S</m> or <m>x \notin S</m>.

            Assume that we have a working definition of a set.
            In this part of the activity we define a subset of a set.
            The notation we will use is
            <m>A \subset S</m> if <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m> that is not equal to <m>S</m>,
            and <m>A \subseteq S</m> if <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m> that could be the entire set <m>S</m>.
            We will also say that <m>A</m> is <term>contained</term>
            in <m>S</m> if <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>S</m>,
            and call the relation <m>A \subset S</m>
            (or <m>A \subseteq S</m>)
            a <term>containment</term>.
