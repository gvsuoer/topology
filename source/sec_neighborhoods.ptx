  <idx><h><m>\delta</m>-neighborhood of a point in a metric space</h></idx>
  <p>
    We are familiar with the idea of open intervals in <m>\R</m>.
    We next introduce the idea of an open neighborhood of a point and characterize continuity in terms of neighborhoods.
    This is the next step in developing the notation of continuity in topological spaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open ball <m>B(a, \delta)</m> in a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is also called the
    <term><m>\delta</m>-neighborhood</term> around <m>a</m>.
    A neighborhood of a point can be thought of as any set that envelops that point.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X, d_X)</m> be a metric space, and let <m>a \in X</m>.
        A subset <m>N</m> of <m>X</m> is a <term>neighborhood</term> of <m>a</m> if there exists a
        <m>\delta \gt 0</m> such that <m>B(a, \delta) \subseteq N</m>.
      </p>

  <example xml:id="exp_neighborhood_MS">
    <statement>
      <p>
       
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <m>\R</m> with the Euclidean metric, the set <m>\R^+</m>
              (the positive real numbers)
              is a neighborhood of <m>a=1</m> because the open ball
              <m>B(1,0.5)</m> is completely contained in <m>\R^+</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <m>\R</m> with the Euclidean metric,
              the set <m>\Z</m> is not a neighborhood of <m>a=1</m> because any open ball centered at <m>a=1</m> will contain some non-integers.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In <m>\R</m> with the discrete metric,
              the set <m>\Z</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a=1</m> because the open ball <m>B(a,1) = \{a\}</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    As another example, the open ball
    <m>B(a, \delta)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
    We can say even more about open balls.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X, d)</m> be a metric space,
      let <m>a \in X</m>, and let <m>\delta \gt 0</m>.
      In this activity we ask the question,
      is <m>B(a, \delta)</m> a neighborhood of each of its points?
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>b \in B(a, \delta)</m>.
            What do we have to do to show that
            <m>B(a, \delta)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>b</m>?
          </p>
        </statement>

        <statement>
          <p>
            Use <xref ref="F_Open_ball_neighborhood"/>
            to help show that <m>B(a, \delta)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>b</m>.

          <p>
            Is the converse true?
            That is, if a set is a neighborhood of each of its points,
            is the set an open ball?
            No proof is necessary, but a convincing argument is in order.
