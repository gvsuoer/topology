  <title>To the Instructor</title>
  <p>
    While this text is intended as a one semester introduction to point-set topology,
    there is more material in the text than my students have been able to comfortably digest in a single semester.
    With that in mind,
    some care should be taken to ensure that what you feel are the most important topics are ones that are discussed.
    As mentioned earlier, I think students really benefit from a thorough review and discussion of sets and functions in the first two sections.
    From there, the sections build on each other.
    However, one can omit <xref ref="sec_metric_spaces_apps">Section</xref>
    on Applications of Metric Spaces without loss of continuity.
    My goal for a single semester course is to be sure that we can investigate compactness and connectedness.
    With this in mind,
    it is possible to omit <xref ref="sec_quotients">Section</xref>
    on quotient spaces if time is tight.
