  <title>Open and Closed Sets in Subspaces</title>
  <p>
    We saw in our preview activity that a subspace does not necessarily inherit the properties of the larger space.
    For example,
    a subset of a subspace might be open in the subspace,
    but not open in the larger space.
    However, there is a connection between the open subsets in a subspace and the open sets in the larger space.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_relatively_open_ms">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
        A subset <m>O_A</m> of <m>A</m> is open in <m>A</m> if and only if there is an open set <m>O_X</m> in <m>X</m> so that <m>O_A = O_X \cap A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
      Let <m>O_A</m> be an open subset of <m>A</m>.
      So for each <m>a \in A</m> there is a
      <m>\delta_a \gt 0</m> so that <m>B_A(a, \delta_a) \subseteq O_A</m>,
      where <m>B_A(a, \delta_a)</m> is the open ball in <m>A</m> centered at <m>a</m> of radius <m>\delta_a</m>.
      Then, <m>O_A~=~\bigcup_{a \in O_A}~B_A(a, \delta_a)</m>.
      Now let <m>B_X(a, \delta_a)</m> be the open ball in <m>X</m> centered at <m>a</m> of radius <m>\delta_a</m>,
      and let <m>O_X = \bigcup_{a \in O_A} B_X(a, \delta_a)</m>.
      Note that
      <me>
        B_A(a, \delta_a)~=~B_X(a, \delta_a)~\cap~A
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a union of open balls in <m>X</m>,
      the set <m>O_X</m> is open in <m>X</m>.
      Now
      <me>
        O_X \cap A = \left(\bigcup_{a \in O_A} B_X(a, \delta_a) \right) \cap A = \bigcup_{a \in O_A} \left( B_X(a, \delta_a) \cap A \right) = \bigcup_{a \in O_A} B_A(a, \delta_a) = O_A
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there is an open set <m>O_X</m> in <m>X</m> such that <m>O_A = O_X \cap A</m>.

      Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.

    We might now wonder about closed sets in a subspace.
    If <m>X</m> is a metric space and <m>A</m> is a subspace,
    then by definition a subset <m>C_A</m> of <m>A</m> is closed if and only if
    <m>C_A = A \setminus O_A</m> for some set <m>O_A</m> that is open in <m>A</m>.
    The analogy of <xref ref="thm_relatively_open_ms"/>
    is true for closed sets in subspaces.
