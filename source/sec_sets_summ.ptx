  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          We can consider a set to be a well-defined collection of elements.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset of a set is any collection of elements from that set.
          That is, a subset <m>S</m> of a set <m>X</m> is a set with the property that if <m>s \in S</m>,
          then <m>s \in X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are sets,
          then the union <m>X \cup Y</m> is the set
          <me>
            X \cup Y = \{z \mid z \in X \text{ or }  z \in Y\}
          </me>.
          The union of an arbitrary collection
          <m>\{X_{\alpha}\}</m> of sets for <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m> is the set
          <me>
            \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} X_{\alpha} = \{z \mid z \in X_{\beta} \text{ for some }  \beta \in I\}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> are sets,
          then the intersection <m>X \cap Y</m> is the set
          <me>
            X \cap Y = \{z \mid z \in X \text{ and }  z \in Y\}
          </me>.
          The intersection of an arbitrary collection
          <m>\{X_{\alpha}\}</m> of sets for <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m> is the set
          <me>
            \bigcap_{\alpha \in I} X_{\alpha} = \{z \mid z \in X_{\beta} \text{ for all }  \beta \in I\}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>X</m> is a set and <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>X</m>,
          then the complement of <m>A</m> in <m>X</m> is the set
          <me>
            A^c = \{x \in X \mid x \notin A\}
          </me>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>\{X_{i}\}</m> is a collection of sets with <m>i</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m>,
          where <m>I</m> is finite or <m>I</m> is the set of positive integers,
          the Cartesian product <m>\Pi_{i \in I} X_i</m> of the sets <m>X_{i}</m> as the set of all ordered tuples of the form <m>(x_i)</m> where <m>i \in I</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
