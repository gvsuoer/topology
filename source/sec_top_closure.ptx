  <title>Closure in Topological Spaces</title>
  <p>
    Once we have a definition of limit point,
    we can define the closure of a set just as we did in metric spaces.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The closure<idx><h>closure in topological spaces</h></idx> of a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is the set
        <me>
          \overline{A} = A \cup A'
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    In other words,
    the closure of a set is the collection of the elements of the set and the limit points of the set.
    The following theorem is the analog of the theorem in metric spaces about closures.
  </p>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_TS_closure_closed">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
        The closure of a <m>A</m> is a closed set.
        Moreover, the closure of <m>A</m> is the smallest closed subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
      To prove that <m>\overline{A}</m> is a closed set,
      we will prove that <m>\overline{A}</m> contains its limit points.
      Let <m>x \in \overline{A}'</m>.
      To show that <m>x \in \overline{A}</m>,
      we proceed by contradiction and assume that <m>x \notin \overline{A}</m>.
      This implies that <m>x \notin A</m> and <m>x \notin A'</m>.
      Since <m>x \notin A'</m>,
      there exists a neighborhood <m>N</m> of <m>x</m> that contains no points of <m>A</m> other than <m>x</m>.
      But <m>A \subseteq \overline{A}</m> and <m>x \notin \overline{A}</m>,
      so it follows that <m>N \cap A = \emptyset</m>.
      This implies that there is an open set
      <m>O \subseteq N</m> centered at <m>x</m> so that <m>O \cap A = \emptyset</m>.
      The fact that <m>x \in \overline{A}'</m> means that
      <m>O \cap \overline{A}</m> contains a point <m>y</m> in
      <m>\overline{A}</m> different from <m>x</m>.
      Since <m>O \cap A = \emptyset</m>,
      we must have <m>y \in A'</m>.
      But the fact that <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of <m>y</m> means that <m>O</m> must contain a point of <m>A</m> different than <m>y</m>,
      which contradicts the fact that <m>O \cap A = \emptyset</m>.
      We conclude that <m>x \in \overline{A}</m> and <m>\overline{A}' \subseteq \overline{A}</m>.
      This shows that <m>\overline{A}</m> is a closed set.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof that <m>\overline{A}</m> is the smallest closed subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m> is left for the next activity.

            What will we have to show to prove that

            Suppose that <m>C</m> is a closed subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m>.
            To show that <m>\overline{A} \subseteq C</m>,
            why is it enough to demonstrate that <m>A' \subseteq C</m>?

    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_TS_closure_closed">Theorem</xref> is the following.

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>C</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C = \overline{C}</m>.
