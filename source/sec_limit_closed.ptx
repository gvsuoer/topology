  <title>Limit Points and Closed Sets</title>
  <p>
    There is a connection between limit points and closed sets.
    The open set <m>(1,2)</m> in
    <m>(\R, d_E)</m> does not contain all of its limit points or any of its boundary points,
    while the closed set <m>[1,2]</m> contains all of its boundary and limit points.
    This is an important attribute of closed sets.
    Recall that for a limit point <m>x</m> of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m>,
    every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> different from <m>x</m>.
    We can make the neighborhoods as small as we like so, in a sense,
    the limit points of <m>A</m> that are not in <m>A</m> are the points in <m>X</m> that are arbitrarily close to the set <m>A</m>.
    We denote the set of limit points of <m>A</m> as <m>A'</m>,
    and the limit points of a set can tell us if the set is closed.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>C</m> be a subset of a metric space <m>X</m>,
        and let <m>C'</m> be the set of limit points of <m>C</m>.
        Then <m>C</m> is closed if and only if <m>C' \subseteq C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space,
      and let <m>C</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      First we assume that <m>C</m> is closed and show that <m>C</m> contains all of its limit points.
      Let <m>x \in X</m> be a limit point of <m>C</m>.
      We proceed by contradiction and assume that <m>x \notin C</m>.
      Then <m>x \in X \setminus C</m>, which is an open set.
      This implies that there is an
      <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m> so that <m>B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq X \setminus C</m>.
      But then this neighborhood
      <m>B(x, \epsilon)</m> contains no points in <m>C</m>,
      which contradicts the fact that <m>x</m> is a limit point of <m>C</m>.
      We conclude that <m>x \in C</m> and <m>C</m> contains all of its limit points.

      The converse of the result we just proved is the subject of the next activity.

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>C</m> be a subset of a metric space <m>X</m>,
      and let <m>C'</m> be the set of limit points of <m>C</m>.
      In this activity we prove that <m>C</m> is closed if <m>C</m> contains all of its limit points.
      So assume <m>C' \subseteq C</m>.

            If we proceed by contradiction to prove that <m>C</m> is closed,
            we assume that <m>C</m> is not closed.
            What does this tell us about <m>X \setminus C</m>?
