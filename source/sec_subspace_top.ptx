    In our preview activity,
    we saw that the intersection of the open sets in a topological space <m>X</m> with any nonempty subset <m>A</m> of <m>X</m> forms a topology for <m>A</m>.
    We then have <m>A</m> as a subspace of <m>X</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The topology <m>\tau_A</m> in <xref ref="def_TS_subspace"/>
    is called the <term>subspace topology</term>,
    the <term>induced topology</term>,
    or the <term>relative topology</term>.
    In our preview activity we saw that sets that are open in a subspace <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> need not be open in <m>X</m>.
    So we call the sets in <m>\tau_A</m>
    <term>relatively open</term>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once we have defined relatively open sets,
    we can then consider how to define relatively closed sets.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Recall that a subset of a topological space is closed if its complement is open.
            Given that <m>(A, \tau_A)</m> is a topological space,
            how is a closed set in <m>A</m> defined?
            Such a set will be called <term>relatively closed</term>.

        <statement>
          <p>
            Recall that a subset <m>U</m> of <m>A</m> is relatively open if and only if
            <m>U = A \cap O</m> for some open subset of <m>X</m>.
            With this in mind,
            how might we expect a relatively closed set in <m>A</m> to be related to a closed set in <m>X</m>?
            State and prove a theorem for this result.
