  <title>Neighborhoods in Topological Spaces</title>
  <p>
    Recall that we defined a neighborhood of a point <m>a</m> in a metric space to be a subset of the space that contains an open ball centered at <m>X</m>.
    Every open ball is an open set,
    so we can extend the idea of neighborhood to topological spaces.

    <idx><h>neighborhood in a topological space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space, and let <m>a \in X</m>.
        A subset <m>N</m> of <m>X</m> is a <term>neighborhood</term> of <m>a</m> if <m>N</m> contains an open set that contains <m>a</m>.

    Let's look at some examples.
  </p>

  <activity>
    <introduction>
    <p>
      Let <m>X = \{a,b,c,d\}</m> and let <m>\tau = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}, X \}</m>.
    </p>
    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find all of the neighborhoods of the point <m>a</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Find all of the neighborhoods of the point <m>c</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>

  <p>
    In metric spaces,
    an open set was a neighborhood of each of its points.
    This is also true in topological spaces.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space.
        A subset <m>O</m> of <m>X</m> is open if and only if <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a topological space,
      and let <m>O</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      First we demonstrate that if <m>O</m> is open,
      then <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
      Assume that <m>O</m> is an open set, and let <m>a \in O</m>.
      Then <m>O</m> contains the open set <m>O</m> that contains <m>a</m>,
      so <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverse containment is the subject of the next activity.
    </p>
  </proof>
