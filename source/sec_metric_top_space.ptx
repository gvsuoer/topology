  <title>Metric Spaces and Topological Spaces</title>
  <p>
    Every metric space is a topological space,
    where the topology is the collection of open sets defined by the metric.
    This topology is called the <term>metric topology</term>.

    A natural question to ask is whether every topological space is a metric space.
    That is, given a topological space,
    can we define a metric on the space so that the open sets are exactly the sets in the topology?
    For example,
    any space with the discrete topology is a metric space with the discrete metric.

      Let <m>X = \{a,b,c,e\}</m> and <m>\tau = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}, X \}</m>.
      Explain why there cannot be a metric
      <m>d : X \times X \to \R</m> so that the open sets in the metric topology are the sets in <m>\tau</m>.

        Assume that such a metric exists and consider the open balls centered at <m>c</m>.

    We conclude that every metric space is a topological space,
    but not every topological space is a metric space.
    The topological spaces that can be realized as metric spaces are called <term>metrizable</term>.
