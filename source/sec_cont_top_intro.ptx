    Recall that we could characterize a function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a metric space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> as continuous at <m>a \in X</m> if
    <m>f^{-1}(N)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m> in <m>X</m> whenever <m>N</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
    We have defined neighborhoods in topological spaces,
    so we can use this characterization as our definition of a continuous function from one topological space to another.

    <statement>
      <p>
        A function <m>f</m> from a topological space
        <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> to a topological space
        <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m> is <term>continuous at a point</term> <m>a \in X</m> if
        <m>f^{-1}(N)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m> in <m>X</m> whenever <m>N</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
        The function <m>f</m> is continuous if <m>f</m> is <term>continuous</term> at each point in <m>X</m>.

    We saw that in metric spaces,
    a useful characterization of continuity was in terms of open sets.
    It is not surprising that we have the same characterization in topological spaces.
    You may assume the result of <xref ref="thm_PA_TS_Open_continuity"/>
    (the topological space version of <xref ref="thm_Open_continuity"/> for metric spaces)
    for this activity.

        Let <m>f</m> be a function from a topological space

        Then <m>f</m> is continuous if and only if

            It can sometimes be easier to show that a function <m>f</m> mapping a topological space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a topological space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> is continuous by working with a basis instead of all open sets.
            Let <m>\B</m> be a basis for the topology on <m>Y</m>.
            Is it the case that if <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open for every <m>B \in \B</m>,
            then <m>f</m> is continuous?
            Verify your result.

    To complete the introduction to this section,
    we prove <xref ref="thm_PA_TS_Open_continuity"/>.
    We prove one direction now and leave the other for the next activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be a function from a topological space
    <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> to a topological space <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m>.
    We first assume that <m>f</m> is continuous and show that
    <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m> whenever <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>Y</m>.
    Suppose that <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>Y</m>.
    To show that <m>f^{-1}O)</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
    we will show that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
    Let <m>a \in f^{-1}(O)</m>.
    Then <m>f(a) \in O</m>.
    Since <m>O</m> is an open set,
    <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m>.
    The fact that <m>f</m> is continuous means that
    <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
    So <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is an open set.

      Now we prove the remaining implication in <xref ref="thm_PA_TS_Open_continuity"/>.
      That is, let <m>f</m> be a function from a topological space
      <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> to a topological space <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m>,
      and assume that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open whenever <m>O</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.
      We will prove that <m>f</m> is a continuous function.
