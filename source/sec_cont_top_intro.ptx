    Recall that we could characterize a function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a metric space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> as continuous at <m>a \in X</m> if
    <m>f^{-1}(N)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m> in <m>X</m> whenever <m>N</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
    We have defined neighborhoods in topological spaces,
    so we can use this characterization as our definition of a continuous function from one topological space to another.

    We saw that in metric spaces,
    a useful characterization of continuity was in terms of open sets.
    It is not surprising that we have the same characterization in topological spaces.

            It can sometimes be easier to show that a function <m>f</m> mapping a topological space <m>(X,d_X)</m> to a topological space <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> is continuous by working with a basis instead of all open sets.
            Let <m>\B</m> be a basis for the topology on <m>Y</m>.
            Is it the case that if <m>f^{-1}(B)</m> is open for every <m>B \in \B</m>,
            then <m>f</m> is continuous?
            Verify your result.

    To complete the introduction to this section,
    we prove <xref ref="thm_PA_TS_Open_continuity">Theorem</xref>.
    We prove one direction now and leave the other for the next activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Let <m>f</m> be a function from a topological space
    <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> to a topological space <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m>.
    We first assume that <m>f</m> is continuous and show that
    <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m> whenever <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>Y</m>.
    Suppose that <m>O</m> is an open set in <m>Y</m>.
    To show that <m>f^{-1}O)</m> is open in <m>X</m>,
    we will show that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
    Let <m>a \in f^{-1}(O)</m>.
    Then <m>f(a) \in O</m>.
    Since <m>O</m> is an open set,
    <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m>.
    The fact that <m>f</m> is continuous means that
    <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
    So <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is an open set.

    <p>
      Now we prove the remaining implication in <xref ref="thm_PA_TS_Open_continuity">Theorem</xref>.
      That is, let <m>f</m> be a function from a topological space
      <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> to a topological space <m>(Y, \tau_Y)</m>,
      and assume that <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open whenever <m>O</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.
      We will prove that <m>f</m> is a continuous function.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Using the definition,
            what does it take to show that <m>f</m> is a continuous function?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>a \in X</m> and suppose that <m>N</m> is a neighborhood of <m>f(a)</m> in <m>Y</m>.
            What can we conclude from <m>N</m> being a neighborhood?
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Use the assumption about <m>f</m> in this activity to explain why
            <m>f^{-1}(N)</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m> in <m>X</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain how we have shown that <m>f</m> is a continuous function.
