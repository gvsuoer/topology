  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>O</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is an open set if <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
          Alternatively,
          <m>O</m> is open if <m>O</m> is a union of open balls.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A point <m>a</m> in a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> is an interior point of <m>A</m> if <m>A</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
          A set <m>O</m> is open if every point of <m>O</m> is an interior point of <m>O</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The interior of a set is the set of all interior points of the set.
          The interior of a set <m>A</m> in a metric space <m>X</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>.
          A set is open if and only if the set is equal to its interior.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A function <m>f</m> from a metric space <m>X</m> to a metric space <m>Y</m> is continuous if
          <m>f^{-1}(O)</m> is open in <m>X</m> whenever <m>O</m> is open in <m>Y</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Any union of open sets is open,
          while any finite intersection of open sets is open.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
