  <title>Compact Subsets of <m>\R^n</m></title>
  <p>
    The metric space <m>(\R^n,d_E)</m> is not compact since the open cover
    <m>\{B(0, n)\}_{n \in \Z^+}</m> has no finite sub-cover.
    Since we have already shown that
    <m>(\R,d_E)</m> is homeomorphic to the topological subspaces <m>(a,b)</m>,
    <m>(-\infty, b)</m>, and <m>(a,\infty)</m> for any
    <m>a,
    b \in \R</m>, we conclude that no open intervals are compact.
    Similarly, no half-closed intervals are compact.
    In fact, we will demonstrate in this section that the compact subsets of
    <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m> are exactly the subsets that are closed and bounded.
    The first step is contained in the next activity.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      We have seen that compact sets can be either open or closed.
      However, in certain situations compact sets must be closed.
      We investigate that idea in this activity.
      Let <m>A</m> be a compact subset of a Hausdorff topological space <m>X</m>.
      We will examine why <m>A</m> must be a closed set.

          <p>
            To prove that <m>A</m> is a closed set,
            we consider the set <m>X \setminus A</m>.
            What property of <m>X \setminus A</m> will ensure that <m>A</m> is closed?
            How do we prove that <m>X \setminus A</m> has this property?

            Let <m>x \in X \setminus A</m>.
            Assume that <m>A</m> is a nonempty set (why can we make this assumption)?
            For each <m>a \in A</m>,
            why must there exist disjoint open sets <m>O_{xa}</m> and <m>O_a</m> with

            Now find an open subset of

    The result of <xref ref="act_metric_compact_closed"/>
    is summarized in <xref ref="thm_metric_compact_closed"/>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_metric_compact_closed">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is a compact subset of a Hausdorff topological space,
        then <m>A</m> is closed.

    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    <xref ref="thm_metric_compact_closed"/>
    tells us something about compact subsets of <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m>.
    Since every metric space is Hausdorff,
    we can conclude the following corollary.
  </p>

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If <m>A</m> is a compact subset of
        <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m>, then <m>A</m> is closed.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <p>
    To classify the compact subsets of
    <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m> as closed and bounded,
    we need to discuss what it means for a set in <m>\R^n</m> to be bounded.
    The basic idea is straightforward <mdash/> a subset of <m>\R^n</m> is bounded if it doesn't go off to infinity in any direction.
    In other words,
    a subset <m>A</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is bounded if we can construct a box in <m>\R^n</m> that is large enough to contain it.
    Thus, the following definition.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="def_n_cube">
  <idx><h>bounded subset of <m>\R^n</m></h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>A</m> of <m>\R^n</m> is bounded if there exists <m>M \gt 0</m> such that <m>A \subseteq Q^n_M</m>, where
        <me>
          Q^n_M = \{(x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n) \mid -M \leq x_i \leq M \text{ for every }  1 \leq i \leq n\}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    The set <m>Q^n_M</m> in <xref ref="def_n_cube"/>
    is called the <term>standard</term>
    <m>n</m><term>-dimensional cube of size M</term>.
    A standard 3-dimensional cube of size <m>M</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_M_cube"/>.

  </figure>

  <p>
    An important fact about standard <m>n</m>-cubes is that they are compact subsets of <m>\R^n</m>.
    Compactness is a complicated property <mdash/> it is difficult to prove a result that is true about every open cover.
    As a result,
    the proof of <xref ref="thm_Compact_cubes"/> is quite technical,
    but it is a critical step to classifying the compact subsets of <m>\R^n</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_Compact_cubes">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>n \in \Z^+</m>.
        The standard <m>n</m>-dimensional cube of size <m>M</m> is a compact subset of <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>M \gt 0</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      We proceed by contradiction and assume that there is an
      <m>n \in \Z^+</m> and a positive real number <m>M</m> such that <m>Q^n_M</m> is not compact.
      So there exists an open cover
      <m>\{O_{\alpha}\}</m> with <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m> of <m>Q^n_M</m> that has no finite sub-cover.
      Let <m>Q_0 = Q^n_M</m> so that <m>Q_0</m> is an <m>n</m>-cube with side length <m>2M</m>.
      Partition <m>Q_0</m> into <m>2^n</m> uniform sub-cubes of side length
      <m>M = \frac{2M}{2}</m> (a picture for <m>n=2</m> is shown at left in <xref ref="F_Cubes"/>).
    </p>
    <figure xml:id="F_Cubes">

    </figure>

    <p>
      Let <m>Q'_0</m> be one of these sub-cubes.
      The collection <m>\{O_{\alpha} \cap Q'_0\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> is an open cover of <m>Q'_0</m> in the subspace topology.
      If each of these open covers has a finite sub-cover,
      then we can take the union of all of the
      <m>O_{\alpha}</m>s over all of the finite sub-covers to obtain a finite sub-cover of <m>\{O_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> for <m>Q_0</m>.
      Since our cover <m>\{O_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> for <m>Q_0</m> has no finite sub-cover,
      we conclude that there is one sub-cube, <m>Q_1</m>,
      for which the open cover <m>\{O_{\alpha} \cap Q_1\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> has no finite sub-cover.
      Now we repeat the process and partition <m>Q_1</m> into <m>2^n</m> uniform sub-cubes of side length <m>\frac{M}{2}= \frac{2M}{2^2}</m>.
      The same argument we just made tells us that there is a sub-cube <m>Q_2</m> of <m>Q_1</m> for which the open cover
      <m>\{O_{\alpha} \cap Q_2\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> has no finite sub-cover
      (an illustration for the <m>n=2</m> case is shown at middle in <xref ref="F_Cubes"/>).
      We proceed inductively to obtain an infinite nested sequence
      <me>
        Q_0 \supset Q_1 \supset Q_2 \supset Q_3 \supset \cdots \supset Q_k \supset \cdots
      </me>
      of cubes such that for each <m>k \in \Z</m>,
      the lengths of the sides of cube <m>Q_k</m> are <m>\frac{M}{2^{k-1}} = \frac{2M}{2^{k}}</m> and the open cover
      <m>\{O_{\alpha} \cap Q_k\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> of <m>Q_k</m> has no finite sub-cover.
      Now we show that <m>\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_k \neq \emptyset</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For <m>i \in \Z^+</m>,
      let <m>Q_i = [a_{i,1}, b_{i,1}] \times [a_{i,2}, b_{i,2}] \times \cdots [a_{i,n}, b_{i,n}]</m>.
      That is, think of the point
      <m>(a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \ldots,
      a_{i,n})</m> as a lower corner of the cube and the point
      <m>(b_{i,1}, b_{i,2}, \ldots,
      b_{i,n})</m> as an upper corner of the <m>n</m>-cube <m>Q_i</m> (a labeling for <m>n=2</m> and <m>i</m> from 1 to 3 is shown at right in <xref ref="F_Cubes"/>).
      Let <m>q = (\sup\{a_{i,1}\}, \sup\{a_{i,2}\}, \ldots, \sup\{a_{i,n}\})</m>.
      We will show that <m>q \in \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_k</m>.
      Fix <m>r \in \Z^+</m>.
      We need to demonstrate that
      <me>
        q \in Q_r = \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \mid a_{r,s} \leq x_s \leq b_{r,s} \text{ for each }  1 \leq s \leq n\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For each <m>s</m> between 1 and <m>n</m> we have
      <men xml:id="eq_cube_a">
        a_{r,s} \leq \sup\{a_{i,s}\}
      </men>
      because <m>\sup\{a_{i,s}\}</m> is an upper bound for all of the <m>a_{i,s}</m>.
      The fact that our cubes are nested means that
      <md>
        <mrow>a_{1,s} \amp \leq a_{2,s} \leq \cdots,</mrow>
        <mrow>b_{1,s} \amp \geq b_{2,s} \geq \cdots,</mrow>
        <mrow xml:id="eq_cube_b" number="yes">a_{i,s} \amp \leq b_{i,s}</mrow>
      </md>
      for every <m>i</m> and <m>s</m>.
      Since <m>\sup\{a_{i,s}\}</m> is the least upper bound of all of the <m>a_{i,s}</m>,
      property <xref ref="eq_cube_b"/> shows that <m>\sup\{a_{i,s}\} \leq b_{i,s}</m> for every <m>i</m>.
      Thus, <m>\sup\{a_{i,s}\} \leq b_{r,s}</m> and so <m>a_{r,s} \leq \sup\{a_{i,s}\} \leq b_{r,s}</m>.
      This shows that <m>q \in Q_k</m> for every <m>k</m>.
      Consequently,
      <m>q \in \bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_k</m> and <m>\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_k</m> is not empty.
      (The fact that the side lengths of our cubes are converging to 0 implies that <m>\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_k = \{q\}</m>,
      but we only need to know that
      <m>\bigcap_{k=1}^{\infty} Q_k</m> is not empty for our proof.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>\{O_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> is a cover for <m>Q_0</m>,
      there must exist an <m>\alpha_q \in I</m> such that <m>q \in O_{\alpha_q}</m>.
      The set <m>O_{\alpha_q}</m> is open,
      so there exists <m>\epsilon_q \gt 0</m> such that <m>B(q, \epsilon_q) \subseteq O_{\alpha_q}</m>.
      The maximum distance between points in <m>Q_k</m> is the distance between the corner points
      <m>(a_{k,1}, a_{k,2}, \ldots,
      a_{k,n})</m> and <m>(b_{k,1}, b_{k,2}, \ldots, b_{k,n})</m>,
      where each length <m>b_{k,s} - a_{k,s}</m> is <m>\frac{M}{2^{k-1}}</m>.
      The distance formula tells us that this maximum distance between points in <m>Q_k</m> is
      <me>
        D_k = \sqrt{ \sum_{s=1}^n \left(\frac{M}{2^{k-1}}\right)^2} =  \sqrt{ n \left(\frac{M}{2^{k-1}}\right)^2} = \frac{M}{2^{k-1}} \sqrt{n}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now choose <m>K \in \Z^+</m> such that <m>D_K \lt \epsilon_q</m>.
      Then if <m>x \in Q_K</m> we have
      <m>d_E(q,x)\lt D_K</m> and <m>x \in B(q, \epsilon_q)</m>.
      So <m>Q_K \subseteq B(q, \epsilon_q)</m>.
      But <m>B(q, \epsilon_q) \subseteq O_{\alpha_q}</m>.
      So the collection <m>\{O_{\alpha_q} \cap Q_K\}</m> is a sub-cover of <m>\{O_{\alpha} \cap Q_K\}_{\alpha \in I}</m> for <m>Q_K</m>.
      But this contradicts the fact this open cover has no finite sub-cover.
      The assumption that led us to this contradiction was that <m>Q_0</m> was not compact,
      so we conclude that the standard <m>n</m>-dimensional cube of size <m>M</m> is a compact subset of <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>M \gt 0</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_Compact_cubes"/>
    is that any closed interval <m>[a,b]</m> in <m>\R</m> is a compact set.
    But we can say even more <mdash/> that the compact subsets of <m>\R^n</m> are the closed and bounded subsets.
    This will require one more intermediate result about closed subsets of compact topological spaces.

    Now we can prove a major result,

  <theorem>
    <title>The Heine-Borel Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>A</m> of <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m> is compact if and only if <m>A</m> is closed and bounded.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m>.
      Assume that <m>A</m> is closed and bounded.
      Since <m>A</m> is bounded,
      there is a positive number <m>M</m> such that <m>A \subseteq Q^n_M</m>.
      <xref ref="thm_Compact_cubes"/>
      shows that <m>Q^n_M</m> is compact,
      and then <xref ref="thm_closed_compact"/>
      shows that <m>A</m> is compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the converse,
      assume that <m>A</m> is a compact subset of <m>\R^n</m>.
      We must show that <m>A</m> is closed and bounded.
      Now <m>(\R^n, d_E)</m> is a metric space, and so Hausdorff.
      <xref ref="thm_metric_compact_closed"/>
      then shows that <m>A</m> is closed.
      To conclude our proof, we need to demonstrate that <m>A</m> is bounded.
      For each <m>k \gt 0</m>, let
      <me>
        O_k = \{ (x_1,x_2, \ldots, x_n) \mid -k \lt  x_i \lt  k \text{ for every }  1 \leq i \leq n\}
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is, <m>O_k</m> is the open <m>k</m>-cube in <m>\R^n</m>.
      Next let
      <me>
        U_k = O_k \cap A
      </me>
      for each <m>k</m>.
      Since <m>\bigcup_{k \gt 0} O_k = \R^n</m>,
      it follows that <m>\{U_k\}_{k \gt 0}</m> is an open cover of <m>A</m>.
      The fact that <m>A</m> is compact means that there is a finite collection <m>U_{k_1}</m>,
      <m>U_{k_2}</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>U_{k_m}</m> of sets in <m>\{U_k\}_{k \gt 0}</m> that cover <m>A</m>.
      Let <m>K = \max\{k_i \mid 1 \leq i \leq m\}</m>.
      Then <m>U_{k_i} \subseteq U_K</m> for each <m>i</m>,
      and so <m>A \subseteq U_K \subset Q^m_K</m>.
      Thus, <m>A</m> is bounded.
      This completes the proof that if <m>A</m> is compact in <m>\R^n</m>,
      then <m>A</m> is closed and bounded.
