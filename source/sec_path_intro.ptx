    We defined connectedness in terms of separability by open sets.
    There are other ways to look at connectedness.
    For example,
    the subset <m>(0,1)</m> is connected in <m>\R</m> because we can draw a line segment
    (which we will call a <term>path</term>)
    between any two points in <m>(0,1)</m> and remain in the set <m>(0,1)</m>.
    So we might alternatively consider a topological space to be connected if there is always a path from one point in the spaced to another.
    Although this is a new notion of connectedness,
    we will see that path connectedness and connectedness are related.
  </p>
  <p>
    Intuitively,
    a space is path connected if there is a path in the space between any two points in the space.
    To formalize this idea, we need to define what we mean by a path.
    Simply put, a path is a continuous curve between two points.
    We can therefore define a path as a continuous function.

  <definition>
  <idx><h>path</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.
        A <term>path</term>
        from point <m>a</m> to point <m>b</m> in <m>X</m> is a continuous function
        <m>p: [0,1] \to X</m> such that <m>p(0) = a</m> and <m>p(1)=b</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    With the notion of path, we can now define path connectedness.
  </p>

  <definition>
  <idx><h>path connected</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subspace <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is <term>path connected</term>
        if, given any <m>a, b \in A</m> there is a path in <m>A</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
