  <title>The Interior of a Set</title>
  <p>
    Open sets can be characterized in terms of their interior points.
    By definition,
    every open set is a neighborhood of each of its points,
    so every point of an open set <m>O</m> is an interior point of <m>O</m>.
    Conversely, if every point of a set <m>O</m> is an interior point,
    then <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and is open.
    This argument is summarized in the next theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a metric space.
        A subset <m>O</m> of <m>X</m> is open if and only if every point of <m>O</m> is an interior point of <m>O</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    The collection of interior points in a set form a subset of that set,
    called the <term>interior</term> of the set.
  </p>

  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The interior
            <idx><h>interior of a set</h></idx>
        of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Int(A) = \{a \in A \mid a \text{ is an interior point of }  A\}
        </me>.

    One might expect that the interior of a set is an open set.
    This is true, but we can say even more.
    As <xref ref="thm_Interior_MS"/> will show,
    if <m>A</m> is a subset of a metric space <m>X</m>,
    not only is <m>\Int(A)</m> an open set,
    but every open set that is contained in <m>A</m> is a subset of <m>\Int(A)</m>.
    So <m>\Int(A)</m> is the largest,
    in the sense of containment, open subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m>.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_Interior_MS">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space,
        and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
        Then interior of <m>A</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      We need to prove that <m>\Int(A)</m> is an open set in <m>X</m>,
      and that <m>\Int(A)</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m>.
      First we demonstrate that <m>\Int(A)</m> is an open set.
      Let <m>a \in \Int(A)</m>.
      Then <m>a</m> is an interior point of <m>A</m>,
      so <m>A</m> is a neighborhood of <m>a</m>.
      This implies that there exists an
      <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m> so that <m>B(a, \epsilon) \subseteq A</m>.
      But <m>B(a, \epsilon)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points,
      so every point in <m>B(a, \epsilon)</m> is an interior point of <m>A</m>.
      It follows that <m>B(a, \epsilon) \subseteq \Int(A)</m>.
      Thus, <m>\Int(A)</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and,
      consequently, <m>\Int(A)</m> is an open set.
    </p>
    <p>
      The proof that <m>\Int(A)</m> is the largest open subset of <m>X</m> contained in <m>A</m> is left for the next activity.

    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_Interior_MS"/> is the following.
  </p>

  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>O</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is open if and only if <m>O = \Int(O)</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>

  <p>
    The proof is left for <xref ref="ex_O_int_O"/>.
