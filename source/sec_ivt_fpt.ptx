  <title>The Intermediate Value Theorem and a Fixed Point Theorem</title>
  <p>
    In this section we present two important consequences of connectedness.
    The first consequence is the Intermediate Value Theorem.
    In calculus,
    the Intermediate Value Theorem tells us that if <m>f</m> is a continuous function on a closed interval <m>[a,b]</m>,
    then <m>f</m> assumes all values between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>.
    This result seems straightforward if one just draws a graph of a continuous function on a closed interval.
    But a picture is not a proof.
    We state and then prove a more general version of the Intermediate Value Theorem.

  <theorem>
    <title>The Intermediate Value Theorem</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and <m>A</m> a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
        If <m>f : A \to \R</m> is a continuous function,
        then for any <m>a,b \in A</m> and any
        <m>y \in \R</m> between <m>f(a)</m> and <m>f(b)</m>,
        there is a point <m>x \in A</m> such that <m>f(x) = y</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

      In this activity we prove the Intermediate Value Theorem.
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and <m>A</m> a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
      Assume that <m>f : A \to \R</m> is a continuous function,
      and let <m>a,b \in A</m>.

    </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain why we can assume that <m>a \neq b</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Explain what happens if <m>y = f(a)</m> or <m>y=f(b)</m>.

        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Now assume that <m>f(a) \neq f(b)</m>.
            Without loss of generality, assume that <m>f(a) \lt f(b)</m>.
            Why can we say that <m>f(A)</m> is an interval?

        </statement>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            How does the fact that <m>f(A)</m> is an interval complete the proof?
          </p>
        </statement>

  <p>
    Our second consequence of connectedness involves a fixed point theorem.
    Fixed point theorems are important in mathematics.
    A fixed point of a function <m>f</m> is an input <m>c</m> so that <m>f(c) = c</m>.
    There are many fixed point theorems <mdash/> one of the most well-known is the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem that shows that every continuous function from a closed ball <m>B</m> in <m>\R^n</m> to itself must have a fixed point.
    We can use the Intermediate Value Theorem to prove this result in <m>\R</m>.

      In this activity we prove the following theorem.

    <theorem>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a,b \in \R</m> with <m>a \lt b</m>,
          and let <m>f : [a,b] \to [a,b]</m> be a continuous function.
          Then there is a number <m>c \in [a,b]</m> such that <m>f(c) = c</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </theorem>
    <p>
      So let <m>a,b \in \R</m> with <m>a \lt b</m>,
      and let <m>f : [a,b] \to [a,b]</m> be a continuous function.

                <p>
                  What can we say about <m>g(a)</m> and <m>g(b)</m>?
                  Use the Intermediate Value Theorem to complete the proof.
