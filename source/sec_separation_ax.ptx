  <title>Separation Axioms</title>
  <p>
    As we have seen,
    sequences in topological spaces do not generally behave as we would expect them to.
    As a result,
    we look for conditions on topological spaces under which sequences do exhibit some regular behavior.
    In our preview activity we saw that in it is possible in a topological space that single point sets do not have to be closed.
    In <xref ref="act_TS_limits"/>,
    we also saw that limits of sequences in topological spaces are not necessarily unique.
    This type of behavior limits the results that one can prove about such spaces.
    As a result,
    we define classes of topological spaces whose behaviors are closer to what our intuition suggests.

    It is the fact as described in <xref ref="act_Hausdorff"/>
    that we can separate disjoint points by disjoint open sets that separates metric spaces from other spaces where limits are not unique.
    If we restrict ourselves to spaces where we can separate points like this,
    then we might expect to have unique limits.

  <example xml:id="exp_K_topology">
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are examples of Hausdorff spaces that are not the standard metric spaces.
        For example, Let <m>K = \left\{\frac{1}{k} \mid k \text{ is a positive integer } \right\}</m>.
        We use <m>K</m> to make a topology on <m>\R</m> with basis all open intervals of the form <m>(a,b)</m> and all sets of the form <m>(a,b) \setminus K</m>,
        where <m>a \lt b</m> are real numbers.
        This topology adds the extra intervals of the form
        <m>(a,b) \setminus K</m> to the standard open intervals to make a new topology.
        This topology is known as the <m>K</m>-topology on <m>\R</m>.
        Just as in <m>(\R, d_E)</m>,
        if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are distinct real numbers we can separate <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> with open intervals.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>
  <p>
    The reason we defined Hausdorff spaces is because they have familiar properties,
    as the next theorems illustrate.
  </p>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Each single point subset of a Hausdorff topological space is closed.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a Hausdorff topological space,
      and let <m>A = \{a\}</m> for some <m>a \in X</m>.
      To show that <m>A</m> is closed,
      we prove that <m>X \setminus A</m> is open.
      Let <m>x \in X \setminus A</m>.
      Then <m>x \neq a</m>.
      So there exist open sets <m>O_x</m> containing <m>x</m> and <m>O_a</m> containing <m>a</m> such that <m>O_x \cap O_a = \emptyset</m>.
      So <m>a \notin O_x</m> and <m>O_x \subseteq X \setminus A</m>.
      Thus, every point of <m>X \setminus A</m> is an interior point and <m>X \setminus A</m> is an open set.
      This verifies that <m>A</m> is a closed set.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A sequence of points in a Hausdorff topological space can have at most one limit in the space.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a Hausdorff topological space,
      and let <m>(x_n)</m> be a sequence in <m>X</m>.
      Suppose <m>(x_n)</m> converges to <m>a \in X</m> and to <m>b \in X</m>.
      Suppose <m>a \neq b</m>.
      Then there exist open sets <m>O_a</m> of <m>a</m> and <m>O_b</m> of <m>b</m> such that <m>O_a \cap O_b = \emptyset</m>.
      But the fact that <m>(x_n)</m> converges to <m>a</m> implies that there is a positive integer <m>N</m> such that
      <m>x_n \in O_a</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
      But then <m>x_n \notin O_b</m> for any <m>n \geq N</m>.
      This contradicts the fact that <m>(x_n)</m> converges to <m>b</m>.
      We conclude that <m>a=b</m> and that the sequence <m>(x_n)</m> can have at most one limit in <m>X</m>.
    </p>
  </proof>
  <p>
    Hausdorff spaces are important because we can separate distinct points with disjoint open sets.
    It is also of interest to consider what other types of objects we can separate with disjoint open sets.
    For example,
    the indiscrete topology is quite bad in the sense that its open sets can't distinguish between distinct points.
    That is, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are distinct points in a space with the indiscrete topology,
    then every open set that contains <m>x</m> also contains <m>y</m>.
    By contrast,
    in a Hausdorff space we can separate distinct points with disjoint open sets.
    This is an example of what is called a
    <q>separation</q>
    property.
    Other types of separation properties describe different types of topological spaces.
    These separation properties determine what kind of objects we can separate with disjoint open sets <mdash/> e.g., points,
    points and closed sets, closed sets and closed sets.
    The following are the most widely used separation properties.
    These properties rule out kinds of unwelcome properties that a topological space might have.
    For example,
    recall that limits of sequences are unique in Hausdorff spaces.
    (We traditionally call these separation properties
    <q>axioms</q>
    because we generally assume that our topological spaces have these properties.
    However, these are not axioms in the usual sense of the word,
    but rather properties.)

  <p>
    The use of the variable <m>T</m> comes from the German
    <q>Trennungsaxiome</q>
    for separation axioms.
    Note again that these are not technically axioms, but rather properties.
    An interesting question is why we insist that <m>T_3</m> and <m>T_4</m>-spaces also be <m>T_1</m>.
    We want these axioms to provide more separation at the index increases.
    Consider a space <m>X</m> with the indiscrete topology.
    In this space, nothing is separated.
    However, this space is vacuously regular and normal.
    To avoid this seeming incongruity,
    we insist on working only with <m>T_1</m> spaces.
    Note that a space with the indiscrete topology is not <m>T_1</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the case that every <m>T_4</m>-space is <m>T_3</m>,
    every <m>T_3</m>-space is <m>T_2</m>,
    and every <m>T_2</m>-space is <m>T_1</m>.
    Verification of these statements are left to <xref ref="ex_T_1_2_3"/>.
    These properties are also all different.
    That is, there are <m>T_1</m>-spaces that are not <m>T_2</m> and <m>T_2</m>-spaces that are not <m>T_3</m>.
    These problems are given in <xref ref="ex_not_T_1_2_3"/>.
    The fact that there are <m>T_3</m>-spaces that are not <m>T_4</m> is a bit difficult.
    An example is the <term>Niemytzki plane</term>.
    The Niemytzki plane is the upper half plane <m>X = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid y \geq 0\}</m>.
    Let <m>L</m> be the boundary of <m>X</m>.
    That is, <m>L = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid y = 0\}</m>.
    A basis for the topology on <m>X</m> consists of the standard open disks centered at points with <m>y > 0</m> along with the open disks in
    <m>X \setminus L</m> that are tangent to <m>L</m> together with their points of tangency.
    We won't verify that the Niemytzki plane is <m>T_3</m> but not <m>T_4</m>.
    The interested reader can find an accessible proof in the article
    <q>Another Proof that the Niemytzki Plane is not Normal</q>
    by David H. Vetterlein in the <term>Pi Mu Epsilon Journal</term>, Vol. 10, No. 2 (SPRING 1995), pp. 119-121.
