  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        A subset <m>C</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is closed if <m>X \setminus C</m> is open.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Any intersection of closed sets is closed,
        while unions of finitely many closed sets are closed.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A sequence in a topological space <m>X</m> is a function <m>f: \Z^+</m> to <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A sequence <m>(x_n)</m> in a topological space <m>X</m> converges to a point <m>x</m> in <m>X</m> if for each open set <m>O</m> containing <m>x</m>,
        there exists a positive integer <m>N</m> such that
        <m>x_n \in O</m> for all <m>n \geq N</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        If a sequence <m>(x_n)</m> in a topological space <m>X</m> converges to a point <m>x</m>,
        then <m>x</m> is a limit of the sequence <m>(x_n)</m>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A limit point of a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is a point <m>x \in X</m> such that every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> different from <m>x</m>.
        A subset <m>C</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C</m> contains all of its limit points.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A boundary point of a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is a point <m>x \in X</m> such that every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> and a point in <m>X \setminus A</m>.
        The boundary of <m>A</m> is the set
        <me>
          \Bdry(A) = \{x \in X \mid x \text{ is a boundary point of }  A\}
        </me>.
        A subset <m>C</m> of <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C</m> contains its boundary.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A topological space <m>X</m> is Hausdorff if we can separate distinct points with open sets in the space.
        That is, if for each pair <m>x</m>,
        <m>y</m> of distinct points in <m>X</m>,
        there exists open sets <m>O_x</m> of <m>x</m> and <m>O_y</m> of <m>y</m> such that <m>O_x \cap O_y = \emptyset</m>.
        Hausdorff spaces are important because sequences have unique limits in Hausdorff spaces and single point sets are closed.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Separation axioms tell us what kinds of objects can be separated by open sets.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a <m>T_1</m>-space,
            we can separate two distinct points with one open set.
            That is, given distinct points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in a <m>T_1</m> topological space <m>X</m>,
            there is an open set <m>U</m> that separates <m>y</m> from <m>x</m> in the sense that <m>y \in U</m> but <m>x \notin U</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a <m>T_2</m>-space <m>X</m> we can separate points more distinctly.
            That is, if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are different points in <m>X</m>,
            there exist disjoint open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> such that <m>x \in U</m> and <m>y \in V</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a <m>T_3</m>-space <m>X</m> we can separate a point from a closed set that does not contain that point.
            That is, if <m>C</m> is a closed subset of <m>X</m> and <m>x</m> is a point not in <m>C</m>,
            there exists disjoint open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> in <m>X</m> such that <m>C \subseteq U</m> and <m>x \in V</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In a <m>T_4</m>-space <m>X</m> we can separate disjoint closed sets.
            That is, if <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are disjoint closed subsets of <m>X</m>,
            there exist disjoint open sets <m>U</m> and <m>V</m> such that
            <m>C \subseteq U</m> and <m>D \subseteq V</m>.
          </p>
