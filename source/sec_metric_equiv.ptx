  <title>Metric Equivalence</title>
  <p>
    We have seen that we can make a set into a metric space with different metrics.
    For example, the spaces <m>(\R^2, d_E)</m>, <m>(\R^2, d_T)</m>,
    <m>(\R^2, d_M)</m>, and <m>(\R^2, d)</m> are all metric spaces,
    where <m>d_E</m> is the Euclidean metric,
    <m>d_T</m> the taxicab metric,
    <m>d_M</m> the max metric, and <m>d</m> the discrete metric.
    But are these metric spaces really
    <q>different</q>
    metric spaces?
    What do we mean by
    <q>different</q>?

      We might consider two metric spaces <m>(X, d_X)</m> and
      <m>(Y, d_Y)</m> to be equivalent if we can find a bijection between the two sets <m>X</m> and <m>Y</m> that preserves the metric properties.
      That is, find a bijective function <m>f : X \to Y</m> such that
      <m>d_X(a,b) = d_Y(f(a),
      f(b))</m> for all <m>a,b \in X</m>.
      In other words, <m>f</m> preserves distances.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Let <m>X = ((0,1), d_X)</m> and <m>Y = ((0,2), d_Y)</m>,
            with both <m>d_X</m> and <m>d_Y</m> the Euclidean metric.
            Is it possible to find a bijection
            <m>f : X \to Y</m> that preserves the metric properties?
            Explain.
          </p>

        <li>
          <p>
            Now let <m>X = ((0,1), d_X)</m> and <m>Y = ((0,2), d_Y)</m>,
            where <m>d_X</m> is defined by
            <m>d_X(a,b) = 2 | a-b |</m> and <m>d_Y = d_E</m>.
            You may assume that <m>d_X</m> is a metric.
            Is it possible to find a bijection
            <m>f : X \to Y</m> that preserves the metric properties?
            Explain.

    If there is a bijection between metric spaces that preserves distances,
    we say that the metric spaces are
    <term>metrically equivalent</term>.

  <definition xml:id="def_MS_metric_equivalence">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Two metric spaces <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> are metrically equivalent

        if there is a bijection <m>f : X \to Y</m> such that

        </me>
        for all <m>x,y \in X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Because <m>f</m> is a bijection,
    it will also be the case in <xref ref="def_MS_metric_equivalence">Definition</xref> that
    <me>
      d_Y(u,v) = d_X(f^{-1}(u), f^{-1}(v))

    for all <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> in <m>Y</m>.
    The proof is left for Exercise <xref ref="ex_isometry_reverse"/>.

  <p>
    Any function <m>f</m> that preserves distances
    (like the one in <xref ref="def_MS_metric_equivalence">Definition</xref>)

    Metric equivalence is a very strong type of equivalence <mdash/> the existence of an isometry does not allow for much flexibility since distances must be preserved.
    From a topological perspective,
    we are only concerned about the open sets <mdash/> there are no distances.
    The open unit ball in <m>(\R^2, d_E)</m> and the open ball in <m>(\R^2, d_M)</m>
    (where <m>d_E</m> is the Euclidean metric and <m>d_M</m> is the max metric)
    are not that different as we can see in <xref ref="F_Equivalence"/>.
    If we don't worry about preserving distances,
    we can stretch the open ball <m>B_E = B((0,0),1)</m> in
    <m>(\R^2, d_E)</m> along the lines <m>y=x</m> and <m>y=-x</m> uniformly in a way to mold it onto the unit ball
    <m>B_M = B((0,0),1)</m> in <m>(\R^2, d_M)</m>.
    The important thing is that this stretching will preserve the open sets.
    This is a much more forgiving type of equivalence and maintains the central idea of topology that we have discussed <mdash/> what properties of a space are not altered by stretching and bending the space.
    This type of equivalence that allows us to manipulate a space without fundamentally changing the open sets is called
    <term>topological equivalence</term>.
