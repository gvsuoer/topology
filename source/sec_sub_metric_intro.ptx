    Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space,
    and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
    We can make <m>A</m> into a metric space itself in a very straightforward manner.
    When we do so, we say that <m>A</m> is a
    <term>subspace</term> of <m>X</m>.

      Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space,
      and let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>.
      To make the subset <m>A</m> into a metric space,
      we need to define a metric on <m>A</m>.
      For us to consider <m>A</m> as a subspace of <m>X</m>,
      we want the metric on <m>A</m> to agree with the metric on <m>X</m>.
      So we define <m>d' : A \times A \to \R</m> by
      <me>
        d'(a_1,a_2) = d(a_1,a_2)
      </me>
      for all <m>a_1, a_2 \in A</m>.
      Note that <m>d</m> and <m>d'</m> are different functions because they have different domains.
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Show that <m>d'</m> is a metric on <m>A</m>.
            Since <m>d'</m> is a metric on <m>A</m> it follows that <m>(A,d')</m> is a metric space.
            The metric <m>d'</m> is the <term>restriction</term>
            of <m>d</m> to <m>A \times A</m> and can also be denoted by <m>d_A</m>.
            <definition>
              <statement>
                <p>
                  Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space.
                  A subspace<idx><h>subspace of a metric space</h></idx> of <m>(X,d)</m> is a subset <m>A</m> of <m>X</m> together with the metric <m>d_A</m> from
                  <m>A \times A</m> to <m>\R</m> defined by
                  <me>
                    d_A(a_1,a_2) = d(a_1,a_2)
                  </me>
                  for all <m>a_1,a_2 \in A</m>.
                </p>
              </statement>
            </definition>
            We might wonder what, if any,
            properties of the space <m>X</m> are inherited by a subspace.

            Let <m>(X,d) = (\R,d_E)</m> and let <m>A = [0,1]</m>.
            Let <m>0 \lt a \lt 1</m>.
            Is the set <m>[0,a)</m> open in <m>X</m>?
            Is the set <m>[0,a)</m> open in <m>A</m>?

            Let <m>(X,d) = (\R^2,d_E)</m>,
            let <m>A = \{(x,0) \mid x \in \R\}</m>
            (the <m>x</m>-axis in <m>\R^2</m>),
            and let <m>Z = \{(x,0) \mid 0 \lt x \lt 1\}</m>.
            Note that <m>Z \subset A \subset X</m> and we can consider <m>Z</m> as a subspace of <m>A</m> and <m>X</m>,
            and <m>A</m> as a subspace of <m>X</m>.
