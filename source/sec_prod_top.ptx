    In <xref ref="sec_metric_subspaces"/>
    we saw how we can make a Cartesian product of two metric spaces into a metric space.
    This is exactly the construction that allows us to work with the Cartesian plane <m>\R^2</m> as a metric space with the usual metric.
    As we discussed in <xref ref="sec_top_spaces"/>,
    every metric space is a topological space,
    but not every topological space is metrizable.
    So knowing how to make a product of metric spaces into a metric space still leaves open the question of how we can make the product of topological spaces into a topological space.
    If we have two topological spaces
    <m>(X, \tau_X)</m> and <m>(Y , \tau_Y)</m>,
    a natural approach to this problem might be to take as the open sets in
    <m>X \times Y</m> the sets of the form <m>U \times V</m> where
    <m>U \in \tau_X</m> and <m>V \in \tau_Y</m>.
    We investigate this idea in Preview <xref ref="PA_pd_top_1"/>.

      Let <m>X = \{a,b,c\}</m> with <m>\tau_X = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, X\}</m>,
      and let <m>Y = \{1,2\}</m> with <m>\tau_Y = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, Y\}</m>.

            Let
            <men xml:id="eq_prod_basis">
              \CB = \{U \times V \mid U \in \tau_X \text{ and }  V \in \tau_Y\}
            </men>.
            List all of the sets in <m>\CB</m> along with their elements.

            Assume that all of the sets in <m>\CB</m> are open sets in <m>X \times Y</m>.
            Should the set <m>A = \{(a,1), (a,2), (b,1)\}</m> be an open set in <m>X \times Y</m>?
            Is the set <m>A</m> of the form
            <m>U \times V</m> for some open sets <m>U</m> in <m>X</m> and <m>V</m> in <m>Y</m>?
            Explain.
            Is <m>\CB</m> a topology on <m>X \times Y</m>?

          <p>
            If <m>\CB</m> is not a topology on <m>X \times Y</m>,
            what is the smallest collection of sets would we need to add to <m>\CB</m> to make a topology on <m>X \times Y</m>?
            Explain your process.
