        For each of the following functions,
        determine if the function is an injection,
        a surjection, a bijection, or none of these.
        Remember to be careful about the domain and range in each case.
        Justify all of your conclusions.

          <p>
            Start by calculating several outputs for the function before you attempt to write a proof.
            In exploring whether or not the function is an injection,
            it might be a good idea to use cases based on whether the inputs are even or odd.
            In exploring whether <m>f</m> is a surjection,
            consider using cases based on whether the output is positive or less than or equal to zero.

        An operation <m>*</m> on a set <m>S</m> is a function from

        For example,
        addition of integers can be defined as a function <m>f : \Z \times \Z \to \Z</m> that maps the pair
        <m>(a,b)\in \Z \times \Z</m> to the integer <m>f(a,b) = a+b</m>.

            Is it possible to write a formula for <m>g^{-1}\left( [y] \right)</m>,
            where <m>[y] \in \Z_5</m>?
            The answer to this question depends on whether or not it is possible to define a cube root of elements of <m>\Z_5</m>.
            Recall that for a real number <m>x</m>,
            we define the cube root of <m>x</m> to be the real number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^3 = x</m>.
            That is, <m>y = \sqrt[3]{x}</m> if and only if <m>y^3 = x</m>.
            Using this idea,
            is it possible to define the cube root of each element of <m>\Z_5</m>?
            If so, what is <m>\sqrt[3]{[0]}</m>, <m>\sqrt[3]{[1]}</m>,
            <m>\sqrt[3]{[2]}</m>, <m>\sqrt[3]{[3]}</m>, and <m>\sqrt[3]{[4]}</m>.
