        Let <m>O</m> be an open set in a metric space <m>(X,d)</m>.
        Show that a subset <m>U</m> of <m>O</m> is open in

        Let <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y, d_Y)</m> be metric spaces,
        and let <m>f : X \to Y</m> be a continuous function.
        If <m>A</m> is a subspace of <m>X</m>,

        Give a proof that the restriction is continuous,

        It is possible to consider infinite products as metric spaces.
        One important example is a Hilbert space
          <idx><h>Hilbert space</h></idx>
        <m>H</m>, which consists of all infinite sequences <m>(x_n)</m> where
        <m>x_n \in \R</m> for every <m>n</m> and <m>\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty} x_k^2</m> is finite.
        Hilbert space has important applications in physics,
        particularly in quantum mechanics.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Give two distinct elements in <m>H</m> and one infinite sequence that is not in <m>H</m>.
              Explain your examples.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We define the norm of an element <m>x = (x_n)</m> in <m>H</m> as
              <me>
                \lVert x\rVert = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_k^2}
              </me>.
              From this norm we can define a distance between elements <m>x = (x_n)</m> and
              <m>y = (y_n)</m> in <m>H</m> as follows:
              <me>
                d(x,y) = \lVert x-y \rVert
              </me>,
              where <m>x-y = (x_n-y_n)</m>.
              Another way to write <m>d</m> is
              <me>
                d(x,y) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (x_k-y_k)^2}
              </me>.
              One potential problem with this function <m>d</m> is that we need to know that if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are in <m>H</m>,
              then <m>x-y \in H</m>.
              That is, show that if <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_k^2</m> and <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} y_k^2</m> are finite,
              then <m>\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (x_k-y_k)^2</m> is also finite.
              <hint>
                <p>
                  Consider a finite sum and use <xref ref="ex_Subspace_monotone_convergence"/>.
                </p>
              </hint>

          <li>
            <p>
              Show that <m>d</m> is a metric on <m>H</m>.

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let <m>E^m = \{(x_n) \in H \mid x_k = 0 \text{ for } k > m\}</m>.
              Let <m>f: E^m \to \R^m</m> be defined by <m>f((x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty}) = (x_n)_{n=1}^m</m>.
              Show that <m>f</m> is a bijection such that
              <m>d((x_n), (y_n)) = d_E(f((x_n)),
              f((y_n)))</m> for any elements <m>(x_n)</m>, <m>(y_n)</m> in <m>H</m>.
              So <m>E^m</m> is essentially the same as <m>\R^m</m> and so we can consider the space <m>\R^m</m> as embedded in <m>H</m> as a subspace of <m>H</m> for every <m>m \in \Z^+</m>.

        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
