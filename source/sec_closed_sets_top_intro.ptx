  <p>
    We defined a closed set in a metric space to be the complement of an open set.
    Since a topology is defined in terms of open sets,
    we can make the same definition of closed set in a topological space.
    With the definition of closed set in hand,
    we can then ask if it is possible to define limit points,
    boundary,
    and closure in topological spaces and determine if there are corresponding properties for these ideas in topological spaces.

            In <m>\R^n</m> with the Euclidean metric,
            every single element set is closed.
            Does this property hold in the topological space <m>(X, \tau)</m>,
            where <m>X = \{a, b, c\}</m> and <m>\tau = \{\emptyset, \{a\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, X\}</m>?
            Explain.
