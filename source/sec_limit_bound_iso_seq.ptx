  <title>Limit Points, Boundary Points, Isolated Points, and Sequences</title>
  <p>
    Recall that a limit point of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is a point <m>x \in X</m> such that every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> different from <m>x</m>.
    You might wonder about the use of the word
    <q>limit</q>
    in the definition of limit point.
    The next activity should make this clear.

      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space,

    The result of <xref ref="act_CS_3"/>
    is summarized in the following theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_CS_limit_pt">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a metric space,
        let <m>A</m> be a subset of <m>X</m>,
        and let <m>x</m> be a limit point of <m>A</m>.
        Then there is a sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>A</m> that converges to <m>x</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>

  <p>
    Of course, the constant sequence <m>(a)</m> always converges to the point <m>a</m>,
    so every point in a set <m>A</m> is the limit of a sequence.
    With limit points there is a non-constant sequence that converges to the point.
    We might ask what we can say about a point <m>a \in A</m> if the only sequences in <m>A</m> that converges to <m>a \in A</m> are the eventually constant sequences <m>(a)</m>. (By an eventually constant sequence <m>(a_n)</m>,
    we mean that there is a positive integer <m>K</m> such that for <m>k \geq K</m>,
    we have <m>a_k = a</m> for some element <m>a</m>.) That is the subject of our next activity.

    Boundary points are points that are, in some sense, situated
    <q>between</q>
    a set and its complement.
    We will make this idea of
    <q>between</q>
    more concrete soon.
  </p>
  <p>
    An argument just like the one in <xref ref="act_CS_3"/>
    gives us the following result about boundary points.

        Then there are sequences <m>(x_n)</m> in
