  <title>Path Connectedness as an Equivalence Relation</title>
  <p>
    We saw that we could define an equivalence relation using connected subsets of a topological space,
    which partitions the space into a disjoint union of connected components.
    We might expect to be able to do something similar with path connectedness.
    The main difficulty will be transitivity.
    As illustrated in <xref ref="F_path_transitive"/>,
    if we have a path <m>p</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> and a path <m>q</m> from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m>,
    it appears that we can just follow the path <m>p</m> from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>,
    then path <m>q</m> from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m> to have a path from <m>a</m> to <m>c</m>.
    But there are two problems to consider:
    how do we define this path as a function from <m>[0,1]</m> into our space,
    and how do we know the resulting function is continuous.
    The next lemma will help.

    <title>The Gluing Lemma</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
            <idx><h>Gluing Lemma</h></idx>
        Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be closed subsets of a space <m>X = A \cup B</m>, and let <m>f:A \to Y</m> and <m>g: B \to Y</m> be continuous functions into a space <m>Y</m> such that <m>f(x)=g(x)</m> for all <m>x \in (A \cap B)</m>.
        Then the function <m>h:X \to Y</m> defined by
        <me>
          h(x) = \begin{cases}f(x) \amp \text{ if }  x \in A \\ g(x) \amp \text{ if }  x \in B \end{cases}
        </me>
        is continuous.
      </p>

  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> be closed subsets of a space <m>X = A \cup B</m>,
      and let <m>f:A \to Y</m> and
      <m>g: B \to Y</m> be continuous functions into a space <m>Y</m> such that <m>f(x)=g(x)</m> for all
      <m>x \in (A \cap B)</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_Gluing_Lemma"/>.
      Define <m>h: X \to Y</m> by
      <me>
        h(x) = \begin{cases}f(x) \amp \text{ if }  x \in A \\ g(x) \amp \text{ if }  x \in B. \end{cases}
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      To show that <m>h</m> is continuous,
      let <m>C</m> be a closed subset of <m>Y</m>.
      Then
      <me>
        h^{-1}(C) = \{x \in X \mid h(x) \in C\} = \{x \in A \mid f(x) \in C\} \cup \{x \in B \mid g(x) \in C\} = f^{-1}(C) \cup g^{-1}(C)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since <m>f</m> is continuous,
      <m>f^{-1}(C)</m> is closed in the subspace topology on <m>A</m> and since <m>g</m> is continuous
      <m>g^{-1}(C)</m> is closed in the subspace topology on <m>B</m>.
      So <m>f^{-1}(C) = A \cap D</m> and
      <m>g^{-1}(C) = B \cap E</m> for some closed sets <m>D</m> and <m>E</m> of <m>X</m>.
      The fact that <m>A</m> is closed in <m>X</m> implies that
      <m>A \cap D</m> is closed in <m>X</m>.
      Similarly, the fact that <m>B</m> is closed in <m>X</m> implies that
      <m>B \cap E</m> is closed in <m>X</m>.
      Thus,
      <me>
        h^{-1}(C) = f^{-1}(C) \cup g^{-1}(C) = (A \cap D) \cup (B \cap E)
      </me>
      is a finite union of closed sets in <m>X</m> and so is closed in <m>X</m>.
      Since <m>h^{-1}(C)</m> is closed for every closed set in <m>Y</m>,
      it follows that <m>h</m> is continuous.
    </p>

    We can use the Gluing Lemma to create a path from <m>a</m> to <m>c</m> given a path from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> and a path from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m>.

      Use the Gluing Lemma to explain why the path product given in the following definition is actually a path from <m>p(0)</m> to <m>q(1)</m>.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>p</m> be a path from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> and <m>q</m> a path from <m>b</m> to <m>c</m> in a space <m>X</m>.
          The path product
              <idx><h>path product</h></idx>
          <m>q*p</m> is the path in <m>X</m> defined by
          <me>
            (q*p)(x) = \begin{cases}p(2x) \amp \text{ for }  0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2} \\ q(2x-1) \amp \text{ for }  \frac{1}{2} \leq x \leq 1. \end{cases}

    Now we can show that path connectedness defines an equivalence relation on a topological space.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X,\tau)</m> be a topological space.
      Define a relation on <m>X</m> as follows:
      <men xml:id="eq_path_equivalence">
        a \sim b \text{ if there is a path in }  X \text{ from }  a \text{ to }  b
      </men>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why <m>\sim</m> is a reflexive relation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why <m>\sim</m> is a symmetric relation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Explain why <m>\sim</m> is a transitive relation.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </activity>
  <p>
    Since <m>\sim</m> as defined in <xref ref="eq_path_equivalence"/> is an equivalence relation,
    the relation partitions <m>X</m> into a union of disjoint equivalence classes.
    The equivalence class of an element <m>[a]</m> is called a
    <term>path component</term> of <m>X</m>,
    and is the largest path connected subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>a</m>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The path component
            <idx><h>path component</h></idx>
        of an element <m>a</m> in a topological space
        <m>(X, \tau)</m> is the largest path connected subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>a</m>.
