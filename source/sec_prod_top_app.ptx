    Computers represent information from the real world digitally.
    That is, a computer screen consists of discrete pixels that are used to mimic the continuous information from the real world.
    So we exist in <m>\R^3</m>,
    but a computer screen represents information in <m>\Z^2</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_Digital_plane">Figure</xref>.
    It is important to be able to accurately mimic the continuous information from digital data.
    One of the key ideas is to have a digital version of the Jordan curve theorem which states that a Jordan curve (a continuous loop that does not intersect itself) in the Euclidean plane separates the remainder of the plane into two connected components
    (the inside and the outside of the curve).
    Additionally, if a single point is removed from a Jordan curve,
    the remainder of the plane becomes connected.
    The reason a digital Jordan curve theorem is important is that it is only necessary to save the Jordan curves which determine regions,
    along with the associated colors of the regions,
    rather than having to save the color of every single pixel in an image.

    A natural start to building a digital topology might be to identify neighborhoods.
    The idea of a neighborhood is to consider elements that are close to a point,
    and in the digital world there are different ways to do this.
    Given a point <m>(x,y)</m> in <m>\Z^2</m>,
    the 4-neighbors of <m>(x,y)</m> are the points vertically or horizontally adjacent to <m>(x,y)</m>:
    that is, the points <m>(x \pm 1, y)</m> and <m>(x, y \pm 1)</m>.
    The 8-neighbors of <m>(x,y)</m> are the 4-neighbors along with the points diagonally adjacent to <m>(x,y)</m>:
    that is, <m>(x \pm 1, y)</m>,
    <m>(x, y \pm 1)</m>, <m>(x \pm 1, y \pm 1)</m>.
    These neighbors are illustrated in <xref ref="F_Digital_plane">Figure</xref>,
    with the crosses indicating the neighbors of the highlighted point.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the continuous case,
    we define a path between points to be a continuous function from <m>[0,1]</m> to the space.
    However, we cannot have continuity in the digital world.
    So we define paths by moving through neighbor points.
    That is, if <m>k</m> is either <m>4</m> or <m>8</m>,
    a <m>k</m>-path is a finite sequence <m>p_0</m>,
    <m>p_1</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>p_m</m> in <m>\Z^2</m> such that <m>p_1</m> is a <m>k</m>-neighbor of <m>p_2</m>,
    <m>p_2</m> is a <m>k</m>-neighbor of <m>p_3</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
    <m>p_{m-1}</m> is a <m>k</m>-neighbor of <m>p_m</m>.

            Show that there is a <m>4</m>-path connecting any two points in <m>\Z^2</m>.

            In the continuous case,
            every Jordan curve separates <m>\R^2</m> into two connected regions.
            To have a similar theorem in the discrete case,
            we need a notion of connectedness in <m>\Z^2</m>.
            Every image is made up of a finite number of pixels,
            and so we can think of a digital image as existing in a finite subspace of <m>\Z^2</m>.
            Since connectedness and path connectedness are equivalent in finite topological spaces,
            we us the idea of <m>k</m>-paths to define connectedness in <m>\Z^2</m>.
            We say that a subset <m>S</m> of <m>\Z^2</m> is
            <m>k-connected</m> if if any two of its points can be joined by a <m>k</m>-path in <m>S</m>.

            show two sets (curves) in the digital plane indicated by the points that connect the line segments (examples taken from A Topological Approach to Digital Topology, T. Yung Kong, R. Kopperman,
            and P. Meyer,
            <term>American Mathematical Monthly</term>, 98 (1991), no. 10, 901-917).
            Let <m>S_1</m> be the set illustrated at left in <xref ref="F_Digital_curves">Figure</xref>
            and <m>S_2</m> the set at right.

            We can now define a Jordan <m>k</m>-curve to be a finite <m>k</m>-connected set which contains exactly two <m>k</m>-neighbors for each of its points.
            Is <m>S_1</m> a Jordan <m>4</m>-curve?
            Is <m>S_1</m> a Jordan <m>8</m>-curve?

            As usual, we define a component to be a maximal connected set.
            Explain why <m>S_1</m> is a Jordan <m>8</m>-curve whose complement is connected and why <m>S_2</m> is a Jordan <m>4</m>-curve whose complement consists of three connected <m>4</m>-components.
            This example shows that there is no Jordan curve theorem in digital topology using the standard notions of <m>k</m>-connectedness with <m>k</m> either <m>4</m> or <m>8</m>.
            So neither 4-adjacency nor 8-adjacency provides an analogue of the Jordan curve theorem and it is necessary to use a combination of both.
            That is, a Jordan <m>4</m>-curve with at least five points separates <m>\Z^2</m> into exactly two <m>8</m>-components,
            and a Jordan <m>8</m>-curve with at least five points separates <m>\Z^2</m> into exactly two <m>4</m>-components.
