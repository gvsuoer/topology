    As <xref ref="act_connected_subsets_R"/> demonstrates,
    spaces like <m>A = (1,2) \cup (3,4)</m> are not connected.
    Even so, <m>A</m> is made of two connected subsets <m>(1,2)</m> and <m>(3,4)</m>.
    These connected subsets are called <term>components</term>.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subspace <m>C</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is a component
            <idx><h>component</h></idx>
        (or connected component) of <m>X</m> if <m>C</m> is connected and there is no larger connected subspace of <m>X</m> that contains <m>C</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    As an example, if <m>X = (1,2) \cup [4,10) \cup \{-1,15\}</m>,
    then the components of <m>X</m> are <m>(1,2)</m>, <m>[4,10)</m>,
    <m>\{-1\}</m> and <m>\{15\}</m>.
    As the next activity shows,
    we can always partition a topological space into a disjoint union of compenents.

      Let <m>(X, \tau)</m> be a nonempty topological space.

            Suppose that <m>X</m> is a topological space and
            <m>\{A_{\alpha}\}</m> for <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m> is a collection of connected subsets of <m>X</m>.
            Let <m>A = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}</m>.
            Suppose that <m>\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \neq \emptyset</m>.
            Show that <m>A</m> is a connected subset of <m>X</m>.

            Part (a) shows that every element in <m>x</m> belongs to some connected subset of <m>X</m>.
            So we can write <m>X</m> as a union of connected subsets.
            But there is probably overlap.
            To remove the overlap,
            we define the following relation <m>\sim</m> on <m>X</m>: For <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in <m>X</m>,
            <m>x \sim y</m> if <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are contained in the same connected subset of <m>X</m>.
            As with any relation, we ask if <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Is <m>\sim</m> a reflexive relation?

    <xref ref="act_connected_compenent"/>
    shows that the relation <m>\sim</m> is an equivalence relation,
    and so partitions the underlying topological space <m>X</m> into disjoint sets.
    If <m>x \in X</m>,
    then the equivalence class of <m>x</m> is a connected subset of <m>X</m>.
    There can be no larger connected subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>x</m>,
    since equivalence classes are disjoint or the same.
    So the equivalence classes are exactly the connected components of <m>X</m>.
    The components of a topological space <m>X</m> satisfy several properties.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Each <m>a \in X</m> is an element of exactly one connected component <m>C_a</m> of <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A component <m>C_a</m> contains all connected subsets of <m>X</m> that contain <m>a</m>.
          Thus, <m>C_a</m> is the union of all connected subsets of <m>X</m> that contain <m>a</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are in <m>X</m>,
          then either <m>C_a = C_b</m> or <m>C_a \cap C_b = \emptyset</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Every connected subset of <m>X</m> is a subset of a connected component.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Every connected component of <m>X</m> is a closed subset of <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The space <m>X</m> is connected if and only if <m>X</m> has exactly one connected component.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
