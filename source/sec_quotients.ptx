  <title>Introduction</title>

    We are familiar with the word <em>quotient</em>
    when working with rational numbers.
    That is, the fraction <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> is the quotient of <m>1</m> by <m>2</m>,
    and the set of rational numbers is the collection of all defined quotients of integers.
    The word quotient seems to have come from the latin word
    <q>quotiens</q>, which can be translated as
    <q>how often</q>
    or
    <q>how many times</q>. We can think of the fraction
    <m>\frac{1}{2}</m> as dividing a unit (<m>1)</m> into two pieces.
    So we often apply the word quotient to any kind of construction that divides a set into pieces.
    Another familiar quotient construction is the set <m>\Z_n</m>,
    the set of quotients of integers after we divide by <m>n</m>.
    Another way to think of <m>\Z_n</m> is as a quotient <m>\Z/n\Z</m>,
    where <m>n\Z</m> is the set of multiples of <m>n</m> and two integers <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> are equal if <m>b-a \in n\Z</m>.
    This defines the relation of congruence module <m>n</m> on <m>\Z</m>,
    and the elements of <m>\Z/n\Z</m> are the equivalence classes for this relation.
    We make similar constructions in many branches of mathematics by defining an equivalence relation on a set,
    and we then divide the set into pieces
    (the equivalence classes)
    and call the set of equivalence classes a
    <em>quotient space</em>.
    We explore the concept of quotient spaces of topological spaces in this section.

    As an example, take the interval
    <m>X = [0,1]</m> in <m>\R</m> and bend it to be able to glue the endpoints together.
    The resulting object is a circle.
    By identifying the endpoints <m>0</m> and <m>1</m> of the interval,
    we are able to create a new topological space.
    We can view this gluing or identifying of points in the space <m>X</m> in a formal way that allows us to recognize the resulting space as a quotient space.
