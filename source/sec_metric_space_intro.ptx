    Metric spaces are particular examples of topological spaces.
    A metric space is a space that has a metric defined on it.
    A metric is a function that measures the distance between points in a metric space.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are familiar with one special metric,
    the Euclidean metric <m>d_E</m> in <m>\R^2</m> where
    <me>
      d_E((x_1,x_2),(y_1,y_2)) = \sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2 + (x_2-y_2)^2}
    </me>.
  </p>
  <figure xml:id="F_Euclidean_metric">

    <image width="73%" source="Euclidean_metric"/>
  </figure>
  <p>
    Using this metric,
    the distance between two points <m>(x_1,x_2)</m> and
    <m>(y_1,y_2)</m> is the length of the segment connecting the points,
    while the unit circle
    (the set of points a distance 1 from the origin)
    looks like what we think of as a circle as illustrated in <xref ref="F_Euclidean_metric">Figure</xref>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As we will see,
    there are many other metrics that can be defined on <m>\R^n</m>,
    or on other sets.
  </p>
  <activity>
    <p>
      Consider the function <m>d_T</m> that assigns to each pair of points in <m>\R^2</m> the real number
      <me>
        d_T((x_1,x_2),(y_1,y_2)) = | x_1-y_1 | + | x_2-y_2 |
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This function <m>d_T</m> is sometimes called the <em>taxicab metric</em>
          <idx><h>metric</h><h>taxicab</h></idx>
      or <em>distance</em> because the distance between points <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> can be thought of as obtained by driving around a city block rather than going directly from point <m>x</m> to point <m>y</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any distance function should satisfy certain properties:
      the distance between two points should never be negative,
      the distance from point <m>A</m> to point <m>B</m> should be the same as the distance from point <m>B</m> to point <m>A</m>,
      the shortest distance between two points <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> should never be more than the distance from <m>A</m> to some point <m>C</m> plus the distance from <m>C</m> to <m>B</m>,
      and the distance between points should only be zero if the points are the same.
      In this activity, we determine if <m>d_T</m> has these properties.
      Let <m>x=(x_1,x_2)</m> and <m>y=(y_1,y_2)</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task: Prove that <m>d_T(x,y) \geq 0</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task: Prove that <m>d_T(x,y) = d_T(y,x)</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task: Prove that <m>d_T(x,y) = 0</m> if and only if <m>x = y</m>.

    <p>
      Task: Let <m>z = (z_1,z_2)</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
      Read the proof of <xref ref="lem_abs_TI">Lemma</xref>
      (below) and then use <xref ref="lem_abs_TI">Lemma</xref> to show that
      <me>
        d_T(x,y) \leq d_T(x,z) + d_T(z,y)
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Do you have any questions about the proof of the lemma?)
    </p>
    <lemma xml:id="lem_abs_TI">
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be real numbers.
          Then
          <me>
            | a+b | \leq | a | + | b |
          </me>.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </lemma>
    <proof>
      <p>
        Let <m>a</m> and <m>b</m> be real numbers.
        To prove the lemma we consider cases.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <title>Case 1: <m>a \geq 0</m> and <m>b \geq 0</m></title>
          <p>
            In this case <m>a+b</m> is nonnegative and so <m>| a | = a</m>,
            <m>| b | = b</m>, and <m>| a+b | = a+b</m>.
            Then
            <me>
              | a+b | = a+b =  | a | + | b |
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Case 2: <m>a \leq 0</m> and <m>b \leq 0</m></title>
          <p>
            In this case <m>a = -a'</m> and <m>b = -b'</m> where <m>a'</m> and <m>b'</m> are nonnegative.
            It follows from Case 1 that
            <me>
              | a+b | = | -(a'+b') | = | a'+b' | = a'+b' = | a' | + | b' | = | -a' | + | -b' | = | a | + | b |
            </me>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <title>Case 3: One of <m>a</m> or <m>b</m> is positive and the other negative</title>
          <p>
            Without loss of generality we assume <m>a > 0</m> and <m>b \lt 0</m>.
            Again we consider cases.
            Note that <m>b \lt 0</m> implies <m>a+b \lt a</m>.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Suppose <m>b \geq -2a</m>.
                Then <m>a+b \geq -a</m> and so <m>-a \leq a+b \lt  a</m>.
                It follows that
                <me>
                  | a+b | \leq a = | a | \lt  | a | + | b |
                </me>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The last case is when <m>b \lt  -2a</m>.
                In this case <m>-b > 2a</m> and so
                <me>
                  | b | = -b > 2a = 2| a | > | a |
                </me>.
                Then <m>a+b \lt  a = | a | \lt  | b |</m>.
                Finally, <m>a > 0</m> implies <m>a+b > b = -| b |</m>.
                So
                <me>
                  - | b | \lt  a+b \lt  | b |
                </me>
                and
                <me>
                  | a+b | \leq | b | \lt  | a | + | b |
                </me>.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This proves our lemma for every possible pair <m>a</m>,
        <m>b</m>.
      </p>
    </proof>

      Task: A picture to illustrate the taxicab distance <m>d_T</m> between (points <m>x_1,x_2)</m> and
      <m>(y_1,y_2)</m> is shown in <xref ref="F_PA_metric">Figure</xref>.
      Draw a picture of the unit circle
      (the set of points a distance 1 from the origin)
      using the Taxicab metric.
      Explain your reasoning.

  <p>
    The taxicab metric can be extended to <m>\R^n</m> for any <m>n \geq 1</m> as follows.
    If <m>x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots,
    x_n)</m> and <m>y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots,
    y_n)</m> are in <m>\R^n</m>,
    then the taxicab distance <m>d_T(x,y)</m> from <m>x</m> to <m>y</m> is defined as
    <me>
      d_T(x,y) = |x_1-y_1| + |x_2-y_2| + \cdots + |x_n-y_n| = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|
    </me>.
