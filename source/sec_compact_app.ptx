  <title>An Application of Compactness</title>
  <p>
    As mentioned at the beginning of this section,
    compactness is the quality we need to ensure that continuous functions from topological spaces to <m>\R</m> attain their maximum and minimum values.

      In this activity we prove the following theorem.
    </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm_max_min">
      <statement>
        <p>
          A continuous function from a compact topological space to the real numbers assumes a maximum and minimum value.

        <p>
          Let <m>X</m> be a compact topological space and
          <m>f: X \to \R</m> a continuous function.
          What does the continuity of <m>f</m> tell us about <m>f(X)</m> in <m>\R</m>?

      <statement>
        <p>
          Why can we conclude that the set <m>f(X)</m> has a least upper bound <m>M</m>?
          Why must <m>M</m> be an element of <m>f(X)</m>?
