  <title>Sequences and Continuity in Metric Spaces</title>
  <p>
    We have seen that there are different ways to characterize. For example, there is
the <m>\epsilon - \delta</m> definition and a characterization in terms of neighborhoods. In this
section we investigate sequences and limits of sequences in metric spaces, and then
provide a characterization of continuous functions in terms of sequences.

      A reasonable question to ask is if a limit of a sequence is unique.
      We will answer that question in this activity.
      Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space and <m>(a_n)</m> a sequence in <m>X</m>.
      Assume the sequence <m>(a_n)</m> has a limit in <m>X</m>.
      To show that a limit of the sequence <m>(a_n)</m> is unique,
      we need to show that if <m>\lim a_n = a</m> and <m>\lim a_n = a'</m> for some <m>a,
      a' \in X</m>, then <m>a=a'</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose <m>\lim a_n = a</m> and
      <m>\lim a_n = a'</m> for some <m>a, a' \in X</m>.
      Without much to go on it might appear that proving <m>a=a'</m> is a difficult task.
      However, if <m>d(a,a') \lt \epsilon</m> for any <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>,
      then it will have to be the case that <m>a=a'</m>.
      So let <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>.

    Now we will examine how continuity can be described in terms of sequences.
    The basic idea is this.
    Suppose that <m>f : \R \to \R</m> is continuous at a point <m>a</m>.
    This means that <m>f</m> has a limit
    (as a continuous function)
    at <m>a</m>.
    So if we were to take any sequence <m>(a_n)</m> that converges to <m>a</m>,
    then the continuity of <m>f</m> implies that <m>f(a) = f(\lim a_n) = \lim f(a_n)</m>.
    That this is both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for continuity is given in the next theorem.
  </p>

  <theorem xml:id="thm_seq_continuity">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> be metric spaces,
        and let <m>a \in X</m>.
        A function <m>f:X \to Y</m> is continuous at <m>a</m> if and only if
        <m>\lim f(a_n) = f(a)</m> for any sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>X</m> that converges to <m>a</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X,d_X)</m> and <m>(Y,d_Y)</m> be metric spaces,
      let <m>a \in X</m>, and let <m>f: X \to Y</m> be a function.
      Assume that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>a</m>.
      We will show that <m>\lim f(a_n) = f(a)</m> for any sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>X</m> that converges to <m>a</m>.
      Let <m>(a_n)</m> be a sequence in <m>X</m> that converges to <m>a</m> (we know such a sequence exists,
      namely the sequence <m>(a)</m>).
      To verify that <m>\lim f(a_n) = a</m>, let <m>\epsilon \gt 0</m>.
      The fact that <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>a</m> means that there is a <m>\delta \gt 0</m> so that
      <m>d_Y(f(x),
      f(a)) \lt  \epsilon</m> whenever <m>d_X(x,a) \lt  \delta</m>.
      Since <m>(a_n)</m> converges to <m>a</m>,
      we know that there exists a positive integer <m>N</m> such that
      <m>d_X(a_n, a) \lt  \delta</m> whenever <m>n \geq N</m>.
      This implies that
      <me>
        d_Y(f(a_n), f(a)) \lt  \epsilon \ \text{ whenever }  \ n \geq N
      </me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We conclude that if <m>f</m> is continuous at <m>a</m>,
      then <m>\lim f(a_n) = f(a)</m> for any sequence <m>(a_n)</m> in <m>X</m> that converges to <m>a</m>.

      The proof of the reverse implication is contained in the next activity.

    While it can sometimes be difficult to prove a fact about all sequences that converge to a point,
    <xref ref="act_sequence_continuity"/>
    shows that we can use <xref ref="thm_seq_continuity"/>
    to prove that a function <m>f</m> is not continuous at an input <m>a</m> be finding just one sequence <m>(a_n)</m> that converges to <m>a</m> for which <m>\lim f(a_n) \neq f(a)</m>.
    We conclude this section with one final note.

  <p>
    <alert>IMPORTANT NOTE:</alert> <xref ref="thm_seq_continuity"/>
    tells us that if <m>f : X \to Y</m> is a continuous function,
    then <m>f</m> commutes with limits.
    That is, if <m>(a_n)</m> is a sequence in <m>X</m> that converges to <m>a \in X</m>, then
