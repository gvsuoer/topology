  <title>The Closure of a Set</title>
  <p>
    We have seen that the interior of a set is the largest open subset of that set.
    There is a similar result for closed sets.
    For example, let <m>A = (0,1)</m> in <m>(\R, d_E)</m>.
    The set <m>A</m> is an open set,
    but if we union <m>A</m> with its limit points,
    we obtain the closed set <m>C = [0,1]</m>.
    Moreover, The set <m>[0,1]</m> is the smallest closed set that contains <m>A</m>.
    This leads to the idea of the <em>closure</em> of a set.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The closure<idx><h>closure of a set in a metric space</h></idx> of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is the set
        <me>
          \overline{A} = A \cup A'
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>

    In other words,
    the closure of a set is the collection of the elements of the set and the limit points of the set <mdash/> those points that are on the
    <q>edge</q>
    of the set.
    The importance of the closure of a set <m>A</m> is that the closure of <m>A</m> is the smallest closed set that contains <m>A</m>.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_closure_closed">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
        The closure of <m>A</m> is a closed set.
        Moreover, the closure of <m>A</m> is the smallest closed subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
      To prove that <m>\overline{A}</m> is a closed set,
      we will prove that <m>\overline{A}</m> contains its limit points.
      Let <m>x \in \overline{A}'</m>.
      To show that <m>x \in \overline{A}</m>,
      we proceed by contradiction and assume that <m>x \notin \overline{A}</m>.
      This implies that <m>x \notin A</m> and <m>x \notin A'</m>.
      Since <m>x \notin A'</m>,
      there exists a neighborhood <m>N</m> of <m>x</m> that contains no points of <m>A</m> other than <m>x</m>.
      But <m>A \subseteq \overline{A}</m> and <m>x \notin \overline{A}</m>,
      so it follows that <m>N \cap A = \emptyset</m>.
      This implies that there is an open ball
      <m>B \subseteq N</m> centered at <m>x</m> so that <m>B \cap A = \emptyset</m>.
      The fact that <m>x \in \overline{A}'</m> means that
      <m>B \cap \overline{A}</m> contains a point <m>y</m> in
      <m>\overline{A}</m> different from <m>x</m>.
      Since <m>B \cap A = \emptyset</m>,
      we must have <m>y \in A'</m>.
      But this, and the fact that <m>B</m> is a neighborhood of <m>y</m>,
      means that <m>B</m> must contain a point of <m>A</m> different than <m>y</m>.
      But <m>B \cap A = \emptyset</m>,
      so we have reached a contradiction.
      We conclude that <m>x \in \overline{A}</m> and <m>\overline{A}' \subseteq \overline{A}</m>.
      This shows that <m>\overline{A}</m> is a closed set.

      The proof that <m>\overline{A}</m> is the smallest closed subset of <m>X</m> that contains <m>A</m> is left for the next activity.

    One consequence of <xref ref="thm_closure_closed">Theorem</xref> is the following.
  </p>
  <corollary>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>C</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C = \overline{C}</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </corollary>
  <p>
    We can also characterize closed sets as sets that contain their boundaries.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        The boundary <m>\Bdry(A)</m> of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is the set of all boundary points of <m>A</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <theorem xml:id="thm_Closed_boundary">
    <statement>
      <p>
        A subset <m>C</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is closed if and only if <m>C</m> contains its boundary.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <p>
    The proof of <xref ref="thm_Closed_boundary">Theorem</xref>
    is left to Exercise <xref ref="ex_closed_bounded"/>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Recall that a boundary point of a subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is a point <m>x \in X</m> such that every neighborhood of <m>x</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> and a point in <m>X \setminus A</m>.
    The boundary points are those that are somehow
    <q>between</q>
    a set and its complement.
    For example if <m>A = (0,1]</m> in <m>\R</m>,
    the boundary of <m>A</m> is the set <m>\{0,1\}</m>.
    We also have that <m>\overline{A} = [0,1]</m>,
    <m>\R \setminus A = (-\infty, 0] \cup (1, \infty)</m>,
    and <m>\overline{\R \setminus A} = (-\infty, 0] \cup [1, \infty)</m>.
    Notice that <m>\Bdry(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{\R \setminus A}</m>.
    That this is always true is formalized in the next theorem.

  <theorem xml:id="thm_Bd_between">
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
        Then
        <me>
          \Bdry(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}
        </me>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </theorem>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space and <m>A</m> a subset of <m>X</m>.
      To prove <m>\Bdry(A) = \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}</m> we need to verify the containment in each direction.
      Let <m>x \in \Bdry(A)</m> and let <m>N</m> be a neighborhood of <m>x</m>.
      Then <m>N</m> contains a point in <m>A</m> and a point in <m>X \setminus A</m>.
      We consider the cases of <m>x \in A</m> or <m>x \notin A</m>.
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>x \in A</m>.
            Then <m>x \in \overline{A}</m>.
            Also, <m>x \notin X \setminus A</m>,
            so <m>N</m> must contain a point in
            <m>X \setminus A</m> different from <m>x</m>.
            That makes <m>x</m> a limit point of
            <m>X \setminus A</m> and so <m>X \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Suppose <m>x \notin A</m>.
            Then <m>x \in X \setminus A \subseteq \overline{X \setminus A}</m>.
            Also, <m>x \notin A</m>,
            so <m>N</m> must contain a point in <m>A</m> different from <m>x</m>.
            That makes <m>x</m> a limit point of <m>A</m> and so <m>X \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In either case we have <m>x \in \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}</m> and so <m>\Bdry(A) \subseteq \overline{A} \cap \overline{X \setminus A}</m>.
