  <title>Summary</title>
  <p>
    Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          A cover of a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is any collection of subsets of <m>X</m> whose union contains <m>A</m>.
          An open cover is a cover consisting of open sets.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subcover of a cover of a set <m>A</m> is a subset of the cover such that the union of the sets in the subcover also contains <m>A</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A subset <m>A</m> of a topological space is compact if every open cover of <m>A</m> has a finite subcover.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          A continuous function from a compact topological space to the real numbers must attain a maximum and minimum value.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The Heine-Borel Theorem states that the compact subsets of <m>\R^n</m> are exactly the subsets that are closed and bounded.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
