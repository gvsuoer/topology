        A metric on a space <m>X</m> is a function that measures distance between elements in the space.
        More formally,
        a metric on a space <m>X</m> is a function <m>d: X \times X \to \R^+ \cup \{0\}</m> such that

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d(x,y) \geq 0</m> for all <m>x,y \in X</m>,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d(x,y) = 0</m> if and only if <m>x = y</m> in <m>X</m>,

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</m> for all <m>x, y \in X</m>, and

        <li>
          <p>
            <m>d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)</m> for all <m>x,y,z \in X</m>.

      A metric space is any space combined with a metric defined on that space.

        The Euclidean,
        taxicab, and max metric are all metrics on <m>\R^n</m>,
        so they all provide ways to measure distances between points in <m>\R^n</m>.
        These metric are different in how they define the distances.

            The Euclidean metric is the standard metric that we have used through our mathematical careers.
            For elements <m>x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots,
            x_n)</m> and <m>y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots,
            y_n)</m> in <m>\R^n</m>, the Euclidean metric <m>d_E</m> is defined as
            <me>
              d_E(x,y) =  \sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2 + (x_2-y_2)^2 + \cdots (x_n-y_n)^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-y_i)^2}
            </me>.
            With this metric, the unit circle in <m>\R^2</m>
            (the set of points a distance <m>1</m> from the origin)
            is the standard unit circle we know from Euclidean geometry.

            The taxicab metric <m>d_T</m> is defined as
            <me>
              d_T(x,y) = |x_1-y_1| + |x_2-y_2| + \cdots + |x_n-y_n| = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-y_i|
            </me>.
            The unit circle in <m>\R^2</m> using the taxicab metric is the square with vertices <m>(1,0)</m>,
            <m>(0,1)</m>, <m>(-1,0)</m>,
            and <m>(0,-1)</m> when viewed in Euclidean geometry.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The max metric <m>d_M</m> is defined by
            <me>
              d_M(x,y) = \max\{| x_1-y_1 |, | x_2-y_2 |, |x_3-y_3|, \ldots, |x_n-y_n| \} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \{|x_i-y_i|\}
            </me>.
            Under the max metric,
            the unit circle in <m>\R^2</m> is the square with vertices <m>(1,1)</m>,
            <m>(-1,1)</m>, <m>(-1,-1)</m>,
            and <m>(1,-1)</m> when viewed in Euclidean geometry.
