    This text begins by formally introducing sets and functions.
    Although these topics are familiar to students,
    it is my experience that the level of understanding of sets and functions for most students is not yet sufficiently deep enough to ensure success with functions throughout the course.
    Chapter 2 focuses on metric spaces.
    It is my belief and my experience that students better understand the abstract concepts of neighborhoods,
    open sets,
    continuity,
    etc., if they are first experienced in a more familiar,
    concrete context like metric spaces.
    Metric spaces are easier for students to grasp than general topological spaces as they provide a notion of distance that is comforting to students.
    Metric spaces also allow one to introduce and motivate important topological concepts in a more familiar context.
    For example,
    by first encountering continuity of functions in a metric space setting,
    and revisiting the idea from different perspectives,
    the definition of continuity in the more abstract setting of topological spaces seems more accessible and natural.
    This perspective was also noted by Felix Hausdorff,
    who is considered as one of the founders of modern topology.
    His text <em>Grundz&#xfc;ge der Mengenlehre</em>
    (Fundamentals of Set Theory) (Felix Hausdorff, Leipzig, Von Veit, 1914.
    Translated to English as <em>Set Theory</em>
    by John R. Aumann et al, New York, Chelsea PublishingCompany, 1957) provided one of the first systematic treatments of topological spaces.
    As Hausdorff writes (p. 210) concerning the introduction of the concepts of topology following topics of basic set theory,

  <blockquote>
    <q>A quite generally worded theory of this nature would of course cause considerable complications, and deliver few positive results. But among the special examples that occupy a heightened interest belongs, apart from the theory of a [totally] ordered sets, especially the theory of point-sets in space, in fact here the foundational relationship is again a function of pairs of elements, namely the distance between two points: a function which however now is capable of infinitely many values.</q>
