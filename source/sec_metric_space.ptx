  <title>Metric Spaces</title>
  <p>
    For most of our mathematical careers our mathematics has taken place in <m>\R^2</m>,
    where we measure the distance between points <m>(x_1,x_2)</m> and
    <m>(y_1,y_2)</m> with the standard Euclidean distance <m>d_E</m>.
    In our preview activity we saw that the function <m>d_T</m> satisfies many of the same properties as <m>d_E</m>.
    These properties allow us to use <m>d_E</m> or <m>d_T</m> as distance functions.
    We call any distance function a <term>metric</term>,
    and any space on which a metric is defined is called a <term>metric space</term>.

  <definition>

    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>metric</term>
        on a space <m>X</m> is a function
        <m>d : X \times X \to \R^+ \cup \{0\}</m> that satisfies the properties:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>d(x,y) \geq 0</m> for all <m>x,y \in X</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>d(x,y) = 0</m> if and only if <m>x = y</m> in <m>X</m>,
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</m> for all <m>x, y \in X</m>, and
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>d(x,y) \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)</m> for all <m>x,y,z \in X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    Properties 1 and 2 of a metric say that a metric is
    <term>positive definite</term>,
    while property 3 states that a metric is <term>symmetric</term>.
    Property 4 of the definition is usually the most difficult property to verify for a metric and is called the
    <term>triangle inequality</term>.

  <idx><h>metric space</h></idx>
    <statement>
      <p>
        A <term>metric space</term>
        is a pair <m>(X,d)</m>, where <m>d</m> is a metric on the space <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    When the metric is clear from the context,
    we just refer to <m>X</m> as the metric space.

    <introduction>
    <p>
      For each of the following, determine if <m>(X,d)</m> is a metric space.
      If <m>(X,d)</m> is a metric space, explain why.
      If <m>(X,d)</m> is not a metric space,
      determine which properties of a metric <m>d</m> satisfies and which it does not.
      If <m>(X,d)</m> is a metric space,
      give a geometric description of the unit circle
      (the set of all points in <m>X</m> a distance <m>1</m> from the zero element)
      in the space.

    It should be noted that not all metric spaces are infinite.
    We discuss one metric on a finite space in the following example.

      </table>
      <p>
        By definition we have <m>d(x,y) \geq 0</m> for all
        <m>x,
        y \in X</m> with <m>d(x,y) = 0</m> if and only if <m>x=y</m>.
        Since the table is symmetric around the diagonal,
        we can see that <m>d(x,y) = d(y,x)</m> for all <m>x,y \in X</m>.
        The only item to verify is the triangle inequality.
        If <m>d(x,y) = 0</m>, then
        <me>
          d(x,y) = 0 \leq d(x,z) + d(z,y)
        </me>
        for any <m>x,y \in X</m>.
        If <m>d(x,z) = 0</m>, then <m>x=z</m> and
        <me>
          d(x,y) = d(z,y) \leq d(z,z) + d(z,y)
        </me>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That leaves three cases to consider,
        when <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m> are distinct.
        Now
        <md>
          <mrow>d(a,b) \amp = 3 \leq 5+4 = d(a,c) + d(c,b),</mrow>
          <mrow>d(a,c) \amp = 5 \leq 3+4 = d(a,b) + d(b,c),</mrow>
          <mrow>d(b,c) \amp = 4 \leq 3+5 = d(b,a) + d(a,c)</mrow>
        </md>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So <m>d</m> is a metric on <m>X</m>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    <xref ref="exp_finite_ms"/>
    shows that even finite sets can be metric spaces.
    In fact, we can make a finite metric space by taking any finite subset <m>S</m> of a metric space <m>(X,d)</m> and use as a metric the restriction of <m>d</m> to <m>S</m>.
    <xref ref="exp_finite_ms"/>
    illustrates this by letting <m>a = (0,0)</m>,
    <m>b = (3,0)</m>, and <m>c = (3,4)</m> in <m>\R^2</m>.
    Then <m>d</m> is the restriction of the Euclidean metric to the set <m>X</m>.
    Another way to construct a finite metric space is to start with a finite set of points and make a graph with the points as vertices.
    Construct edges so that the graph is connected
    (that is, there is a path from any one vertex to any other)
    and give weights to the edges as illustrated in <xref ref="F_Graph_metric"/>.
    We then define a metric <m>d</m> on <m>S</m> by letting <m>d(x,y)</m> be the length of a shortest path between vertices <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> in the graph.
    For example,
    <m>d(b,c) = d(b,e) + d(e,c) = 9</m> in this example.

  <p>
    Just as with the Euclidean and taxicab metrics,
    item (c) in <xref ref="act_MS_metrics"/>
    can be extended to <m>\R^n</m> as follows.
    If <m>x = (x_1, x_2, \ldots,
    x_n)</m> and <m>y = (y_1, y_2, \ldots,
    y_n)</m> are in <m>\R^n</m>,
    then the maximum distance <m>d_M(x,y)</m> from <m>x</m> to <m>y</m> is defined as
    <me>
      d_M(x,y) = \max\{| x_1-y_1 |, | x_2-y_2 |, |x_3-y_3|, \ldots, |x_n-y_n| \} = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \{|x_i-y_i|\}
    </me>.
  </p>

    The metric <m>d_M</m> is called the <term>max</term> metric.
    In the following section we prove that the Euclidean metric is in fact a metric.
    Proofs that <m>d_T</m> and <m>d_M</m> are metrics are left to <xref ref="ex_Taxicab"/> and <xref ref="ex_Max"/>.
