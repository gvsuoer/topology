        Let <m>X</m> be a topological space and for each <m>x \in X</m> let <m>PC(x)</m> denote the path component of <m>x</m>.
        Prove the following.
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> is a path connected subset of <m>X</m>,
              then <m>A \subseteq PC(x)</m> for some <m>x \in X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The space <m>X</m> is path connected if and only if
              <m>X = PC(x)</m> for some <m>x \in X</m>.

        In <xref ref="act_connected_compenent"/>
        of <xref ref="sec_Connected_topology"/>
        we showed that an arbitrary union of connected sets is connected provided the intersection of those sets is not empty.
        Is the same result true for path connected sets.
        That is, if <m>X</m> is a topological space and
        <m>\{A_{\alpha}\}</m> for <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m> is a collection of path connected subsets of <m>X</m> and <m>\bigcap_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha} \neq \emptyset</m>,
        must it be the case that <m>A = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A_{\alpha}</m> is path connected?
        Prove your answer.

        Let <m>X</m> be the subspace of
        <m>(\R^2, d_E)</m> consisting of the line segments joining the point <m>(0,1)</m> to every point in the set
        <m>\left\{\left(\frac{1}{n}, 0\right) \mid n \in \Z^+\right\}</m> as illustrated in <xref ref="F_harmonic_broom"/>.
        This space is called the <term>harmonic broom</term>.

              Show that the harmonic broom is connected.

              So path connectedness does not imply local path connectedness.

        In <xref ref="ex_PC_harmonic_broom">Exercise</xref>
        we see an example of a space that is path connected but not locally path connected.
        Is it possible to find a space that is locally path connected but not path connected?
        Verify your answer.

    <li>
      <p>
        We know that a space can be connected but not path connected.
        We also know that local path connectedness does not imply connectedness.
        However, if we combine these conditions then a space must be path connected.
        That is, show that if a topological space <m>X</m> is connected and locally path connected,
        then <m>X</m> is path connected.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a nonempty set and let <m>p</m> be a fixed element in <m>X</m>.
        Let <m>\tau_p</m> be the particular point topology and
        <m>\tau_{\overline{p}}</m> the excluded point topology on <m>X</m>.
        That is
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\tau_{p}</m> is the collection of subsets of <m>X</m> consisting of <m>\emptyset</m>,
              <m>X</m>,
              and all of the subsets of <m>X</m> that contain <m>p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\tau_{\overline{p}}</m> is the collection of subsets of <m>X</m> consisting of <m>\emptyset</m>,
              <m>X</m>,
              and all of the subsets of <m>X</m> that do not contain <m>p</m>.

      That the particular point and excluded point topologies are topologies is the subject of Exercises <xref ref="ex_particular_point_topology"/> and <xref ref="ex_excluded_point_topology"/> on <xref ref="ex_particular_point_topology">page</xref>.
      Determine, with proof, the path connected subsets of <m>X</m> when
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <m>X</m> has the particular point topology <m>\tau_p</m>

        For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true.
        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
        If a statement is true, explain why.

              If <m>X</m> is a path connected topological space,
              then any subspace of <m>X</m> is path connected.

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are path connected subspaces of a topological space <m>X</m>,
              then <m>A \cap B</m> is path connected.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              There is no path from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m> in <m>(X, \tau)</m>,
              where <m>\tau</m> is the discrete topology.

          <li>
            <p>
              If <m>X</m> is a compact locally path connected topological space,
              then <m>X</m> has only finitely many path components.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Every locally path connected space is locally connected.
