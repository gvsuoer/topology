  <title>Unions and Intersections of Open Sets</title>
  <p>
    Once we have defined open sets we might wonder about what happens if we take a union or intersection of open sets.

    <xref ref="act_Open_union"/>
    demonstrates that an arbitrary intersection of open sets is not necessarily open.
    However, there are some things we can say about unions and intersections of open sets.
  </p>

  <theorem>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>X</m> be a metric space.
        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any union of open sets in <m>X</m> is an open set in <m>X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Any finite intersection of open sets in <m>X</m> is an open set in <m>X</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
    </statement>
  
  <proof>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a metric space.
      To prove part 1, assume that
      <m>\{O_{\alpha}\}</m> is a collection of open sets in <m>X</m> for <m>\alpha</m> in some indexing set <m>I</m> and let <m>O = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} O_{\alpha}</m>.
      By <xref ref="thm_OS_1"/>,
      we know that <m>O_{\alpha}</m> is a union of open balls for each <m>\alpha \in I</m>.
      Combining all of these open balls together shows that <m>O</m> is a union of open balls and is therefore an open set by <xref ref="thm_OS_1"/>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For part 2, assume that <m>O_1</m>,
      <m>O_2</m>, <m>\ldots</m>,
      <m>O_n</m> are open sets in <m>X</m> for some <m>n \in \Z^+</m>.
      To show that <m>O = \bigcap_{k=1}^n O_k</m> is an open set,
      we will show that <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
      Let <m>x \in O</m>.
      Then <m>x \in O_k</m> for each <m>1 \leq k \leq n</m>.
      Let <m>k</m> be between 1 and <m>n</m>.
      Since <m>O_k</m> is open,
      we know that <m>O_k</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points.
      So there exists <m>\epsilon_k \gt 0</m> such that <m>B(x, \epsilon_k) \subseteq O_k</m>.
      Since there are only finitely many values of <m>k</m>,
      let <m>\epsilon = \min\{\epsilon_k \mid 1 \leq k \leq n\}</m>.
      Then <m>B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq B(x, \epsilon_k)</m> for each <m>k</m> and so <m>B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq \bigcap_{k=1}^n O_k = O</m>.
      Therefore, <m>O</m> is a neighborhood of each of its points and <m>O</m> is an open set.
