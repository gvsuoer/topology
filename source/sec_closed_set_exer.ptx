        Let <m>a \in X</m>, and let <m>r \gt 0</m>.

    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>(X,d)</m> be a metric space.
        We have seen that it is possible for a subset of <m>X</m> to be both open and closed.
        There is a characterization of sets that are both open and closed in terms of their boundaries.
        Find and prove such a characterization.
        (Your statement should have the form: A subset <m>A</m> of a metric space <m>X</m> is both open and closed if and only if the boundary of <m>A</m> is <m>\underline{}</m>.)
