    <statement>
      <p>
        Recall from <xref ref="def_weaker_topologies"/>
        that if <m>\tau_1</m> and <m>\tau_2</m> are two topologies on a set <m>X</m> such that <m>\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2</m>,
        then <m>\tau_1</m> is said to be a <term>coarser</term>
        (or <term>weaker</term>)
        topology than <m>\tau_2</m>, or <m>\tau_2</m> is a <term>finer</term>
        (or <term>stronger</term>)
        topology than <m>\tau_1</m>.
        In this exercise we explore the question of whether compactness is a property that is passed from weaker to stronger topologies or from stronger to weaker.
        Let <m>\tau_1</m> and <m>\tau_2</m> be two topologies on a set <m>X</m>.
        If <m>\tau_1 \subseteq \tau_2</m>,
        what does compactness under <m>\tau_1</m> or <m>\tau_2</m> imply,
        if anything, about compactness under the other topology?
        Justify your answers.

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Even though <m>\R</m> is not a compact space, if <m>x \in \R</m>,
        then <m>x \in [x-1, x+1]</m> and so every point in <m>\R</m> is contained in a compact subset of <m>\R</m>.
        So if we view <m>\R</m> from the perspective of a point in <m>\R</m>,
        the space <m>\R</m> looks compact around that point.
        This is the idea of local compactness.
        Locally compact spaces are important in the general topology of function spaces.

              Consider the Sorgenfrey line from <xref ref="ex_Closed_Sets_Sorgenfrey"/>.
              Recall that the Sorgenfrey line is the space <m>\R</m> with a basis <m>\B = \{[a,b) \mid a \lt b \text{ in } \R\}</m> for its topology.
              Show that the Sorgenfrey line is Hausdorff but not locally compact.

        For each of the following, answer true if the statement is always true.
        If the statement is only sometimes true or never true,
        answer false and provide a concrete example to illustrate that the statement is false.
        If a statement is true, explain why.
