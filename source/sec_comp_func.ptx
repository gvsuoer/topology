  <title>Composites of Functions</title>
  <p>
    In our past mathematical experiences,
    we have often added and multiplied functions together (e.g., if <m>f(x) = x^2</m> and
    <m>g(x) = x+1</m> map from <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>,
    then <m>(fg)(x) = x^2(x+1)</m> and <m>(f+g)(x) = x^2+(x+1)</m>).
    In topology,
    we generally don't care about any algebraic structure a set might have,
    so we will move away from sums and products,
    and focus on compositions of functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    The basic idea of function composition is that, when possible,
    the output of a function <m>f</m> is used as the input of a function <m>g</m>.
    The resulting function can be referred to as
    <q><m>f</m> followed by <m>g</m></q>
    and is called the composite of <m>f</m> with <m>g</m>.
    The notation we use is <m>g \circ f</m>
    (note the order <mdash/> <m>f</m> is applied first).
    For example, if
    <me>
      f(x) = 3x^2 + 2 \text{ and }  g(x) = \sin(x)
    </me>,
    both mapping <m>\R</m> to <m>\R</m>,
    then we can compute <m>(g \circ f)(x)</m> as follows:
    <me>
      (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x)) = g(3x^2 + 2) = \sin\left(3x^2 + 2\right)
    </me>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this case, <m>f(x)</m>,
    the output of the function <m>f</m>,
    was used as the input for the function <m>g</m>.
    This idea motivates the formal definition of the composition of two functions.
  </p>
  <definition>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, and <m>C</m> be nonempty sets,
        and let <m>f : A \to B</m> and <m>g : B \to C</m> be functions.
        The composite<idx><h>composition of functions</h></idx> of <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> is the function <m>g \circ f : A \to C</m> defined by
        <me>
          (g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))
        </me>
        for all <m>x \in A</m>
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>
  <p>
    We refer to the function <m>g \circ f</m> as a composite function,
    and we read <m>(g \circ f)(x)</m> as
    <q><m>g</m> of <m>f</m></q>
    of <m>x</m>.

    In <xref ref="act_functions_1">Activity</xref>,
    we asked questions about whether certain composite functions were injections and/or surjections.
    In mathematics,
    it is typical to explore whether certain properties of an object transfer to related objects.
    In particular,
    we might want to know whether or not the composite of two injective functions is also an injection.
    (Of course, we could ask a similar question for surjections.)
    These questions are explored in the next activity.
