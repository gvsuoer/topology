# *Topology: An Inquiry Based Approach*

The HTML version of the text is possible because of the work of Rob Beezer and the PreTeXt team for the development of the PreTeXt platform. David Farmer at the American Institute of Mathematics provided an initial PreTeXt conversion. From this version, Ian Curtis, Editorial Assistant for the GVSU Libraries, as part of the [Accelerating Open Educational Resources Initiative at Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/library/sc/AcceleratingOER), invested a significant amount of time and effort to create the PreTeXt version that you see. This work was conducted with support from the University Libraries and the GVSU President’s Innovation Fund.

The code used to generate this book can be found in this repository. This includes the PreTeXt XML files (`source/`), figures (`assets/`), customization files (XSL) (`xsl/`), and the output (HTML and PDF). Contributors are encouraged to contact the author with suggestions and/or submit an issue or a pull request with changes, especially regarding accessibility (as mentioned below).

## Accessibility

In creating this PreTeXt version we (the author and the Grand Valley State University Libraries) strive to ensure our tools, devices, services, and environments are available to and usable by as many people as possible.

The web version of *Topology: An Inquiry-Based Approach* incorporates the following features to support accessibility:

* All content can be navigated by use of a keyboard
* Links, headings, and tables have been designed to work with screen readers
* Mathematics in PreTeXt are rendered with MathJax so they can be understood by people using screen readers and/or other assistive devices

We are always looking for how we can make our resources more accessible. If you are having problems accessing this resource, please [contact us by email](mailto:oer@gvsu.edu) to let us know.
