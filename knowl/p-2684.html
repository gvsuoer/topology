<div class="para">As usual, we define a component to be a maximal connected set. Explain why <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> is a Jordan <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span>-curve whose complement is connected and why <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> is a Jordan <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-curve whose complement consists of three connected <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-components. This example shows that there is no Jordan curve theorem in digital topology using the standard notions of <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span>-connectedness with <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> either <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(8\text{.}\)</span> So neither 4-adjacency nor 8-adjacency provides an analogue of the Jordan curve theorem and it is necessary to use a combination of both. That is, a Jordan <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-curve with at least five points separates <span class="process-math">\(\Z^2\)</span> into exactly two <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span>-components, and a Jordan <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span>-curve with at least five points separates <span class="process-math">\(\Z^2\)</span> into exactly two <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-components.</div>
