<div class="para">Introduced by Felix Hausdorff in the early 20th century as a way to measure the distance between sets, the Hausdorff metric (also called the Pompeiu-Hausdorff metric) has since been widely studied and has many applications. For example, the United States military has used the Hausdorff distance in target recognition procedures. In addition, the Hausdorff metric has been used in image matching and visual recognition by robots, medicine, image analysis, and astronomy.</div>
