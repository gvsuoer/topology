<div class="para">The term “connected” should bring up images of something that is one piece, not separated. There is more than one way we can interpret the notion of connectedness in topological spaces. For example, we might consider a topological space to be connected if we can’t separate it into disjoint pieces in any non-trivial way. As another possibility, we might consider a topological space to be connected if there is always a path from one point in the spaced to another, provided we define what “path” means. These are different notions of connectedness, and we focus on the first notion in this section.</div>
