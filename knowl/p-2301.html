<div class="para">It can be difficult to determine if two topological spaces are homeomorphic. We can sometimes use topological invariants to determine if spaces are not homeomorphic. For example, if <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is connected and <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> is not, then <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> are not homeomorphic. But just because two spaces are connected, it does not automatically follow that the spaces are homeomorphic. For example consider the spaces <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([0,2)\text{.}\)</span> Both are connected subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> If we remove a point, say 1, from the set <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\)</span> the resulting space <span class="process-math">\((0,1) \cup (1,2)\)</span> is no longer connected. The same result is true if we remove any point from <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\text{.}\)</span> However, if we remove the point <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\([0,2)\)</span> the resulting space <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\)</span> is connected. So the spaces <span class="process-math">\((0,2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([0,2)\)</span> are fundamentally different in this respect, and so are not homeomorphic. Any set that we can remove from a connected set to obtain a disconnected set is called a <dfn class="terminology">cut set</dfn>.</div>
