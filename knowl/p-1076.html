<div class="para">Once we have defined open sets in metric spaces, it is natural to ask if there are closed sets. Recall that closed intervals are important in calculus because every continuous function on a closed interval attains an absolute maximum and absolute minimum value on that interval. If we have closed sets in metric spaces, we might consider if there is some result that is similar to this for continuous functions on closed sets. In this section we introduce the idea of closed sets in metric spaces and discover a few of their properties.</div>
