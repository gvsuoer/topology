<div class="para">Metrics are used to establish separation between objects. Topological spaces can be placed into different categories based on how well certain types of sets can be separated. We have defined metrics as measuring distances between points in a metric space, and in this activity we extend that idea to measure the distance between a point and a subset in a metric space. However, there are two questions we need to address before we can do so. The first we mentioned in our preview activity. We will assume the <dfn class="terminology">completeness axiom</dfn> of the reals, that is that any subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> that is bounded below always has a greatest lower bound. The second question is whether or not a greatest lower bound is unique.</div>
