<div class="para">What if we changed the set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to be the open interval <span class="process-math">\((-1,0)\text{?}\)</span> What then should <span class="process-math">\(d(x,A)\)</span> be, or should this distance even exist? If we think of the distance between a point and a set as measuring how far we have to travel from the point until we reach the set, then in the case of <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A=(-1,0)\text{,}\)</span> as soon as we travel a distance more than 1 from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in the direction of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we reach the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> So we might intuitively say that <span class="process-math">\(d_E(x,(-1,0)) = 1\)</span> as well. But we cannot define this distance as a distance from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to a point in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(0 \notin A\text{.}\)</span> We need a different way to formulate the notion of a distance from a point to a set.</div>
