<div class="para">Hausdorff spaces are important because we can separate distinct points with disjoint open sets. It is also of interest to consider what other types of objects we can separate with disjoint open sets. For example, the indiscrete topology is quite bad in the sense that its open sets can’t distinguish between distinct points. That is, if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are distinct points in a space with the indiscrete topology, then every open set that contains <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> also contains <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> By contrast, in a Hausdorff space we can separate distinct points with disjoint open sets. This is an example of what is called a “separation” property. Other types of separation properties describe different types of topological spaces. These separation properties determine what kind of objects we can separate with disjoint open sets — e.g., points, points and closed sets, closed sets and closed sets. The following are the most widely used separation properties. These properties rule out kinds of unwelcome properties that a topological space might have. For example, recall that limits of sequences are unique in Hausdorff spaces. (We traditionally call these separation properties “axioms” because we generally assume that our topological spaces have these properties. However, these are not axioms in the usual sense of the word, but rather properties.)</div>
