<div class="para">There is a connection between limit points and closed sets. The open set <span class="process-math">\((1,2)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((\R, d_E)\)</span> does not contain all of its limit points or any of its boundary points, while the closed set <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\)</span> contains all of its boundary and limit points. This is an important attribute of closed sets. Recall that for a limit point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> of a subset <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> of a metric space <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> every neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> contains a point in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> different from <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> We can make the neighborhoods as small as we like so, in a sense, the limit points of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that are not in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> are the points in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> that are arbitrarily close to the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> We denote the set of limit points of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(A'\text{,}\)</span> and the limit points of a set can tell us if the set is closed.</div>
