<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exp_finite_ms.html" title="Example 3.6">Example 3.6</a> shows that even finite sets can be metric spaces. In fact, we can make a finite metric space by taking any finite subset <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> of a metric space <span class="process-math">\((X,d)\)</span> and use as a metric the restriction of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/exp_finite_ms.html" title="Example 3.6">Example 3.6</a> illustrates this by letting <span class="process-math">\(a = (0,0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b = (3,0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c = (3,4)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is the restriction of the Euclidean metric to the set <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Another way to construct a finite metric space is to start with a finite set of points and make a graph with the points as vertices. Construct edges so that the graph is connected (that is, there is a path from any one vertex to any other) and give weights to the edges as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Graph_metric.html" title="Figure 3.8">Figure 3.8</a>. We then define a metric <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> by letting <span class="process-math">\(d(x,y)\)</span> be the length of a shortest path between vertices <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the graph. For example, <span class="process-math">\(d(b,c) = d(b,e) + d(e,c) = 9\)</span> in this example.</div>
