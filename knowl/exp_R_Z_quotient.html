<div class="para">Consider the following situation. Let <span class="process-math">\(X = \R\)</span> with the standard topology and define the relation <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(x \sim y\)</span> if <span class="process-math">\(x - y \in \Z\text{.}\)</span> It is straightforward to show that <span class="process-math">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation. By this equivalence relation, we have <span class="process-math">\(x-1 \sim x\)</span> for every real number <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> This identifies <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> are identified under the relation. So we might expect that <span class="process-math">\(\R/\ssim\)</span> is homeomorphic to the circle <span class="process-math">\(S^1 = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid x^2+y^2 = 1\}\)</span> as a subspace of <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> with the standard topology. Now the objective is to find a homeomorphism between <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\R/\ssim\text{.}\)</span> Since every point on the unit circle has the form <span class="process-math">\((\cos(t), \sin(t))\)</span> for some real number <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> we might try defining <span class="process-math">\(f: (\R/\ssim) \to S^1\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(f([t]) = (\cos(t), \sin(t))\text{.}\)</span> However, we have that <span class="process-math">\(0 \sim 1\text{,}\)</span> which means that <span class="process-math">\([0] = [1]\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(f([0]) \neq f([1])\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not well-defined. Another option might be <span class="process-math">\(f([t]) = (\cos(2 \pi t), \sin(2 \pi t))\text{.}\)</span> In this case, if <span class="process-math">\(x \sim y\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi y\)</span> differ by a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(f([x]) = f([y])\text{.}\)</span> We could then show that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a homeomorphism. We will continue this example shortly.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_find_quotient_space.html#exp_R_Z_quotient" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
