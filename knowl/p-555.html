<div class="para">The Levenshtein metric is one measure of distance that researchers use to understand DNA. DNA is composed of double chains of nucleotides, which wind together to form a double helix. The nucleotides come in four types: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The nucleotides in the two chains of a DNA strand pair together, (A with T, and C with G), so the nucleotides in one chain determine the nucleotides in the other. Therefore, we can represent a DNA strand with a string of letters from the alphabet <span class="process-math">\(\{A, C, G, T\}\text{.}\)</span> One problem DNA researchers have is how to compare two strands of DNA, and the Levenshtein metric is one way that the distance between strands can be measured. Other metrics could be used, but the Levenshtein metric is appropriate to the task for several reasons. During evolution, changes in DNA sequences arise due to nucleotide substitution, or the insertion or deletion of nucleotides. These evolutionary changes can be modeled by the operations that determine the Levenshtein distance better than other metrics. In addition, the Levenshtein metric can be used to calculate distances between strings of different lengths. The Levenshtein metric also has applications in spell checkers, speech recognition, and automated plagiarism detection. To understand how the Levenshtein metric is calculated, consider the question of how far apart the words “green” and “grease” are.</div>
