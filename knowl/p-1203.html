<div class="para">Important ideas that we discussed in this section include the following.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> be a metric space and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> a subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">A point <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\)</span> is a boundary point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> if every neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> contains a point in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and a point in <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus A\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A point <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a limit point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> if every neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> contains a point in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> different from <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A point <span class="process-math">\(a \in A\)</span> is an isolated point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> if there is a neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(N \cap A = \{a\}\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Boundary points and limit points donâ€™t need to be in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> whereas an isolated point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> must be in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(A = (0,1) \cup \{2\}\)</span> as a subset of <span class="process-math">\(=(\R, d_E)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is a boundary point but not an isolated point while <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is a boundary point but not a limit point. Also, <span class="process-math">\(0.5\)</span> is a limit point but neither a boundary or isolated point. With <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with the discrete metric, every point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an isolated point but no point in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is a boundary point or a limit point of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> So even though every boundary point is either a limit point or an isolated point, the three concepts are different.</div>
