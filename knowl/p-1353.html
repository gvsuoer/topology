<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_top_basis.html" title="Activity 12.3">Activity 12.3</a> shows that, just like the open balls in a metric space, a topology can have a collection of subsets whose unions make up all of the open sets in the topology. We do need to take a little care, though. A basis will generate the collection of open sets for a topology, so the basis sets we start with should themselves be open sets. In addition, every element in the topological space should be an element of one of the basis sets, and since the basis elements are to produce all of the open sets in the topology, every set in the topology (except the empty set) should be a union of sets in a basis. It also must be the case that we can ensure that any finite intersection of sets in the topology remains a set in the topology when we write the sets in the topology in terms of the sets in a basis. To make the last two conditions happen, we will see that it is enough to insist that for any point in the intersection of basis elements, there is another basis element in that intersection that contains the point. This is summarized in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_Basis.html" title="Theorem 12.2">Theorem 12.2</a>.</div>
