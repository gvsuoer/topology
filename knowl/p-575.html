<div class="para">If it took three operations to transform “green” into “grease”, we could say that the distance between “green” and “grease” is at most 3. However, it may be possible to transform “green” into “grease” in fewer than 3 operations, which might change our opinion of the distance between these words. In general, to define the Levenshtein distance <span class="process-math">\(d_L\)</span> between a sting <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and a string <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(m_d\)</span> denote the number of deletions, <span class="process-math">\(m_i\)</span> the number of insertions, and <span class="process-math">\(m_s\)</span> the number of substitutions we use to get from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span> There may be many different combinations of <span class="process-math">\(m_d\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(m_i\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m_s\)</span> that get us from <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> so we want the smallest number. <article class="definition definition-like"><h5 class="heading">
