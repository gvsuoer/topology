<div class="para">If you like geometry, you will probably like topology. Geometry is the study of objects with certain attributes (e.g., shape and size), while topology is more general than geometry. In topology, we aren’t concerned about the attributes (shape and size) of an object, only about those characteristics that don’t change when we transform the object in different ways (any way that doesn’t involve tearing or poking holes the object). There are lots of really interesting theorems in topology — for example, the Hairy Ball Theorem which states that if you have a ball with hair all over it (think of a tribble from Star Trek — if that isn’t too old of a reference), it is impossible to comb the hairs continuously and have all the hairs lay flat. Some hair must be sticking straight up!</div>
