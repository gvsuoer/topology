Their thorough reading and comments on the draft have made for a much better book. I am also indebted to my students who have all been test subjects for earlier versions of this material. Without their hard work and suggestions, this book would not exist.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="act_Preface.html#paragraphs-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
