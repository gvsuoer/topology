<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">Acknowledgments.</span></h1> <div class="para">The Grand Valley Steve University libraries provided a grant to support my colleagues, John Golden and Clark Wells, to review a draft version of this text. Their thorough reading and comments on the draft have made for a much better book. I am also indebted to my students who have all been test subjects for earlier versions of this material. Without their hard work and suggestions, this book would not exist.</div> <div class="para">The HTML version of the text is possible because of the work of Rob Beezer and the PreTeXt team for the development of the PreTeXt platform. David Farmer at the American Institute of Mathematics provided an initial PreTeXt conversion. From this version, Ian Curtis, Editorial Assistant for the GVSU Libraries, as part of the <a class="external" href="https://www.gvsu.edu/library/sc/AcceleratingOER" target="_blank">Accelerating Open Educational Resources Initiative at Grand Valley State University</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-2-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, invested a significant amount of time and effort to create the PreTeXt version that you see. This work was conducted with support from the University Libraries and the GVSU President’s Innovation Fund.</div> <div class="para">The code used to generate this book can be found in the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/gvsuoer/topology" target="_blank">GVSU OER GitHub repository</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>. This includes the PreTeXt XML files, figures, customization files (XSL), and the output (HTML and PDF).
