<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\((X, \tau_X)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((Y, \tau_Y)\)</span> be compact topological spaces. Let <span class="process-math">\(\CC = \{O_{\alpha}\}\)</span> be an open cover of <span class="process-math">\(X \times Y\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> in some indexing set <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(a \in X\)</span> and let <span class="process-math">\(Y_a = \{a\} \times Y\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> is homeomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> is compact. The collection <span class="process-math">\(\{O_{\alpha} \cap Y_a\}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\text{,}\)</span> and so has a finite sub-cover <span class="process-math">\(\{O_{\alpha_i}\}_{1 \leq i \leq n}\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(N_a = \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq n} O_{\alpha_i}\)</span> is an open set that contains <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\text{.}\)</span> We will show that there is a neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> that <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> contains the entire set <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Cover the set <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> with open sets that are contained in <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> is open, we can intersect any open set with <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> and still have an open set). Each open set is a union of basis elements, so we can cover <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> with basis elements <span class="process-math">\(U \times V\)</span> that are contained in <span class="process-math">\(N_a\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> is compact, there is a finite collection <span class="process-math">\(U_1 \times V_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(U_2 \times V_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(U_m \times V_m\)</span> of basis elements contained in <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> that cover <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\text{.}\)</span> Assume that each <span class="process-math">\(U_i \times V_i\)</span> intersects <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> (otherwise, we can remove that set and still have a cover). Let <span class="process-math">\(W_a = U_1 \cap U_2 \cap \cdots \cap U_m\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(a \in U_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is not empty. Each <span class="process-math">\(U_i\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Now we demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y \subseteq \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq m} U_i \times V_i\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \in W_a \times Y\text{.}\)</span> Since the collection <span class="process-math">\(\{U_i \times V_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq m}\)</span> covers <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\text{,}\)</span> the point <span class="process-math">\((a,y)\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(U_k \times V_k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(y \in Y_k\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(x \in W_a = \bigcap_{1 \leq i \leq m} U_i\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x \in U_k\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \in U_k \times V_k\)</span> and we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y \subseteq \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq m} U_i \times V_i\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">So for each <span class="process-math">\(a \in X\text{,}\)</span> the set <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> contains a set of the form <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y\)</span> is covered by a finite sub-cover of our open cover <span class="process-math">\(\CC\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(X \times Y\text{.}\)</span> The collection <span class="process-math">\(\{W_a \times Y\}_{a \in X}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="process-math">\(X \times Y\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is compact, the is a finite sub-cover <span class="process-math">\(W_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(W_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(W_r\)</span> of the open cover <span class="process-math">\(\{W_a\}_{a \in X}\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> is an open cover of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> It follows that the sets <span class="process-math">\(W_1 \times Y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(W_2 \times Y\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(W_r \times Y\)</span> is a cover of <span class="process-math">\(X \times Y\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> the set <span class="process-math">\(W_i \times Y\)</span> is covered by finitely many of the sets in <span class="process-math">\(\CC\text{,}\)</span> and so the collection of these sets forms a finite sub-cover of <span class="process-math">\(X \times Y\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\CC\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(X \times Y\)</span> is compact.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_prop_prod_top.html#proof-42" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
