<div class="para"> What we saw in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/pa_sets.html" title="Preview Activity 1.1">Preview Activity 1.1</a> is what is called a <dfn class="terminology">paradox</dfn>. Our original attempt to define a set led to an impossible situation since both <span class="process-math">\(S \in S\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S \notin S\)</span> lead to contradictions. This paradox is called <dfn class="terminology">Russell’s paradox</dfn> after Bertrand Russell, although it was apparently known before Russell. The moral of the story is that we need to be careful when making definitions. A set might seem like a simple object, and in our experi≈ence usually is, but formally defining a set can be problematic. As a result, we won’t state a formal definition, but rather take a set to be a collection of objects that doesn’t lead to a paradox. The objects are called the elements of the set. (In axiomatic set theory, a set is taken to be an undefined primitive — much as a point is undefined in Euclidean geometry.)</div>
