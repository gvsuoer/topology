<div class="para">We are familiar with the word <dfn class="terminology">quotient</dfn> when working with rational numbers. That is, the fraction <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> is the quotient of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> and the set of rational numbers is the collection of all defined quotients of integers. The word quotient seems to have come from the latin word “quotiens”, which can be translated as “how often” or “how many times”. We can think of the fraction <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> as dividing a unit (<span class="process-math">\(1)\)</span> into two pieces. So we often apply the word quotient to any kind of construction that divides a set into pieces. Another familiar quotient construction is the set <span class="process-math">\(\Z_n\text{,}\)</span> the set of quotients of integers after we divide by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Another way to think of <span class="process-math">\(\Z_n\)</span> is as a quotient <span class="process-math">\(\Z/n\Z\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\Z\)</span> is the set of multiples of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and two integers <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are identified with each other (or are <dfn class="terminology">equivalent</dfn>) if <span class="process-math">\(b-a \in n\Z\text{.}\)</span> This defines the relation of congruence module <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{,}\)</span> and the elements of <span class="process-math">\(\Z/n\Z\)</span> are the equivalence classes for this relation. We make similar constructions in many branches of mathematics by defining an equivalence relation on a set, and we then divide the set into pieces (the equivalence classes) and call the set of equivalence classes a <dfn class="terminology">quotient space</dfn>. We explore the concept of quotient spaces of topological spaces in this section.</div>
