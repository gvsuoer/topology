<div class="para">The word “compact” might bring to mind a notion of smallness, but we need to be careful with the term. We might think that the interval <span class="process-math">\((0, 0.5)\)</span> is small, but <span class="process-math">\((0, 0.5)\)</span> is homeomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> which is not small. Similarly, we might think that the interval <span class="process-math">\([-10000, 10000]\)</span> is large, but this interval is homeomorphic to the “small” interval <span class="process-math">\([-0.00001, 0.000001]\text{.}\)</span> As a result, the concept of compactness does not correspond to size, but rather structure, in a way. We will expand on this idea in this section.</div>
