<div class="para">Computers represent information from the real world digitally. That is, a computer screen consists of discrete pixels that are used to mimic the continuous information from the real world. So we exist in <span class="process-math">\(\R^3\text{,}\)</span> but a computer screen represents information in <span class="process-math">\(\Z^2\)</span> as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Digital_plane.html" title="Figure 20.10">FigureÂ 20.10</a>. It is important to be able to accurately mimic the continuous information from digital data. One of the key ideas is to have a digital version of the Jordan curve theorem which states that a Jordan curve (a continuous loop that does not intersect itself) in the Euclidean plane separates the remainder of the plane into two connected components (the inside and the outside of the curve). Additionally, if a single point is removed from a Jordan curve, the remainder of the plane becomes connected. The reason a digital Jordan curve theorem is important is that it is only necessary to save the Jordan curves which determine regions, along with the associated colors of the regions, rather than having to save the color of every single pixel in an image.</div>
