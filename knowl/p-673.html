<div class="para">We have likely had previous experiences with continuous functions. Continuity is an important consideration in optimization problems because a continuous function attains a maximum value and a minimum value on any closed and bounded interval. Continuous functions also satisfy the Intermediate Value Theorem, that a continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> takes on all values between <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(b)\)</span> on an interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{.}\)</span> An important consequence of the Intermediate Value Theorem is that if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a continuous function on an interval and <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(b)\)</span> have opposite signs, then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> must have a root in the interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{.}\)</span> In this section we will begin to explore continuity of functions between metric spaces. Our ultimate goal in future sections is to understand continuous functions well enough that we can define continuity just in terms of open sets.</div>
