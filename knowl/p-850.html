<div class="para">So, by definition, any open ball is an open set. Also by definition, open sets are neighborhoods of each of their points. Open sets are different than non-open sets. For example, <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> is an open set in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> using the Euclidean metric, but <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\)</span> is not. The reason <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\)</span> is not an open set is that there is no open ball centered at <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> that is entirely contained in <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> has a different property than the other points in <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of the points in <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{,}\)</span> but is not a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> We can think of the points in <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> as being in the interior of the set <span class="process-math">\([0,1)\text{.}\)</span> This leads to the next definition.</div>
