<div class="para">Each section of the book contains preview activities, in-class activities, and exercises. The various types of activities serve different purposes.</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Preview activities are designed for students to complete before class to motivate the upcoming topic and prepare them with the background and information they need for the class activities and discussion.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The in-class activities engage students in common intellectual experiences. These activities are used to provide motivation for the material, opportunities for students to prove substantial course material on their own, or examples to help reinforce the meanings of definitions or theorems and their proofs. The ultimate goal is to help students develop their intuition for and understanding of abstract concepts. Students often complete these in-class activities, then present their results to the entire class.</div></li>
