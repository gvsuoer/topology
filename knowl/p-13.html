<div class="para">This text begins by formally introducing sets and functions. Although these topics are familiar to students, it is my experience that the level of understanding of sets and functions for most students is not yet sufficiently deep enough to ensure success with functions throughout the course. <a href="chap_functions.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 2: Functions">Chapter 2</a> focuses on metric spaces. It is my belief and my experience that students better understand the abstract concepts of neighborhoods, open sets, continuity, etc., if they are first experienced in a more familiar, concrete context like metric spaces. Metric spaces are easier for students to grasp than general topological spaces as they provide a notion of distance that is comforting to students. Metric spaces also allow one to introduce and motivate important topological concepts in a more familiar context. For example, by first encountering continuity of functions in a metric space setting, and revisiting the idea from different perspectives, the definition of continuity in the more abstract setting of topological spaces seems more accessible and natural. This perspective was also noted by Felix Hausdorff, who is considered as one of the founders of modern topology. His text <span class="booktitle">Grundzüge der Mengenlehre</span> (Fundamentals of Set Theory) (Felix Hausdorff, Leipzig, Von Veit, 1914. Translated to English as <span class="booktitle">Set Theory</span> by John R. Aumann et al, New York, Chelsea PublishingCompany, 1957) provided one of the first systematic treatments of topological spaces. As Hausdorff writes (p. 210) concerning the introduction of the concepts of topology following topics of basic set theory,</div>
