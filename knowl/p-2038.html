<div class="para">Since a topology defines open sets, topological properties are often defined in terms of open sets. Let us consider an example to see if we can tease out some of the details we will need to get a useful notion of compactness. Consider the open interval <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> Suppose we write <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> as a union of open balls. For example, let <span class="process-math">\(O_n = \left(\frac{1}{n}, 1-\frac{1}{n}\right)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(n \in \Z^+\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n \geq 3\text{.}\)</span> Notice that <span class="process-math">\((0, 1) \subseteq \bigcup_{n \geq 3} O_n\text{.}\)</span> Any collection of open sets whose union contains <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> is called an <dfn class="terminology">open cover</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\text{.}\)</span> Working with a larger number of sets is generally more complicated than working with a smaller number, so it is reasonable to ask if we can reduce the number of sets in our open cover of <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\)</span> and still cover <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\text{.}\)</span> In particular, working with a finite collection of sets is preferable to working with an infinite number of sets (we can exhaustively check all of the possibilities in a finite setting if necessary). Notice that <span class="process-math">\(O_n \subset O_{n+1}\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> so we can eliminate many of the sets in this cover. However, if we eliminate enough sets so that we are left with only finitely many, then there will be a maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(O_n\)</span> remains in our collection. But then <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2n}\)</span> will not be in the union of our remaining collection of sets. As a result, we cannot find a finite collection of the <span class="process-math">\(O_n\)</span> whose union contains <span class="process-math">\((0, 1)\text{.}\)</span> Note that there may be some collections of open sets that cover of <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> for which there is a finite subcollection of sets that also cover <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{.}\)</span> For example, if we let <span class="process-math">\(U_n = \left(n-\frac{3}{4}, n+\frac{3}{4}\right)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\((0,1) \subseteq \bigcup_{n \in \Z} U_n\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((0,1) \subseteq U_{0} \cup U_1\text{.}\)</span> The main point is that there is at least one collection of open sets that covers <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> for which there is no finite subcollection of sets that covers <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{.}\)</span>
