<div class="para">The terminology in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/def_min_nghb.html" title="Definition 19.11">Definition 19.11</a> is apt. Since every neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> of a point <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\)</span> must contain an open set <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x \in O\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(U_x \subseteq O \subseteq N\text{.}\)</span> So every neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\)</span> has <span class="process-math">\(U_x\)</span> as a subset. In addition, when <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is finite, the set <span class="process-math">\(U_x\)</span> is a finite intersection of open sets, so the sets <span class="process-math">\(U_x\)</span> are open sets (this is not true in general in infinite topological spaces — you are asked to find an example in Exercise (\ref{ex:U_x_not_open})). In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_minimal_nbhds.html" title="Activity 19.5">Activity 19.5</a> we saw that <span class="process-math">\(U_x\)</span> was path connected for a particular <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in one example. The next activity shows that this result is true in general in finite topological spaces.</div>
