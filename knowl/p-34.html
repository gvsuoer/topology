<div class="para">Suppose we try to define a set to be a collection of elements. So, by definition, the elements are the objects contained in the set. We use the symbol <span class="process-math">\(\in\)</span> to denote that an object is an element of a set. So <span class="process-math">\(\notin\)</span> means an object is not in the set â€” if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is an object in a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(x \in S\text{,}\)</span> and if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is not an object in a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> we write <span class="process-math">\(x \notin S\text{.}\)</span> We write sets using set brackets. For example, the set <span class="process-math">\(\{a,b,c\}\)</span> is the set whose elements are the symbols <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> We can also include in the set notation conditions on elements of the set. For example, <span class="process-math">\(\{x \in \R : x \gt 0\}\)</span> is the set of positive real numbers. We typically use capital letters to denote sets. Some familiar examples of sets are <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> the set of real numbers; <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{,}\)</span> the set of rational numbers; and <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{,}\)</span> the set of integers. Sets can also contain sets as elements. For example, the power set of a set <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is the set of subsets of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{.}\)</span> So the power set of <span class="process-math">\(S = \{1,2\}\)</span> is the set <span class="process-math">\(\{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}\text{.}\)</span> (We will define subsets and the empty set later in this activity).</div>
