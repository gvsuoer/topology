<div class="para">Boundary points and limit points donâ€™t need to be in the set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> whereas an isolated point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> must be in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(A = (0,1) \cup \{2\}\)</span> as a subset of <span class="process-math">\(=(\R, d_E)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> is a boundary point but not an isolated point while <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> is a boundary point but not a limit point. Also, <span class="process-math">\(0.5\)</span> is a limit point but neither a boundary or isolated point. With <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> as subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with the discrete metric, every point of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an isolated point but no point in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is a boundary point or a limit point of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> So even though every boundary point is either a limit point or an isolated point, the three concepts are different.</div>
