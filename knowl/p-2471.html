<div class="para">We saw that we could define an equivalence relation using connected subsets of a topological space, which partitions the space into a disjoint union of connected components. We might expect to be able to do something similar with path connectedness. The main difficulty will be transitivity. As illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_path_transitive.html" title="Figure 19.5">FigureÂ 19.5</a>, if we have a path <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> and a path <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(c\text{,}\)</span> it appears that we can just follow the path <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> then path <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> to have a path from <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(c\text{.}\)</span> But there are two problems to consider: how do we define this path as a function from <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> into our space, and how do we know the resulting function is continuous. The next lemma will help.</div>
