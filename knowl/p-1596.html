<div class="para">As we have seen, sequences in topological spaces do not generally behave as we would expect them to. As a result, we look for conditions on topological spaces under which sequences do exhibit some regular behavior. In our preview activity we saw that it is possible in a topological space that single point sets do not have to be closed. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act_TS_limits2.html" title="Activity 13.4">ActivityÂ 13.4</a>, we also saw that limits of sequences in topological spaces are not necessarily unique. This type of behavior limits the results that one can prove about such spaces. As a result, we define classes of topological spaces whose behaviors are closer to what our intuition suggests.</div>
