<div class="para">Open sets are vitally important in topology. We will see later that every topological space is completely defined by its open sets, and continuous functions can be defined just in terms of open sets. In this section we introduce the idea of open balls and neighborhoods in metric spaces and discover a few of their properties. This discussion will form the basis for introducing open sets in the next section.</div>
