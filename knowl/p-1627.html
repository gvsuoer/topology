<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_Metric_space_regular.html" title="Exercise 16">Exercise 16</a> shows that every metric space is both regular and normal. The use of the variable <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> comes from the German “Trennungsaxiome” for separation axioms. Note again that these are not technically axioms, but rather properties. An interesting question is why we insist that <span class="process-math">\(T_3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T_4\)</span>-spaces also be <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{.}\)</span> We want these axioms to provide more separation as the index increases. Consider a space <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> with the indiscrete topology. In this space, nothing is separated. However, this space is vacuously regular and normal. To avoid this seeming incongruity, we insist on working only with <span class="process-math">\(T_1\)</span> spaces. Note that a space with the indiscrete topology is not <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{.}\)</span>
