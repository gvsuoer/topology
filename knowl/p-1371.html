<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> be a topological space, and let <span class="process-math">\(\B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> satisfy the given conditions. By definition, <span class="process-math">\(\emptyset \in \tau\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\)</span> there is a set <span class="process-math">\(B_x \in \B\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x \in B_x\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(X = \bigcup_{x \in X} B_x\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(X \in \tau\text{.}\)</span> To complete our proof that <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> is a topology on <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> we need to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. We first consider unions. Let <span class="process-math">\(\{U_{\alpha}\}\)</span> be a collection of sets in <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\alpha\)</span> in some indexing set <span class="process-math">\(I\text{.}\)</span> By definition, each <span class="process-math">\(U_{\alpha}\)</span> is empty or is a union of elements of <span class="process-math">\(\B\text{.}\)</span> So either <span class="process-math">\(U = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_{\alpha}\)</span> is empty, or is a union of sets in <span class="process-math">\(\B\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(U \in \tau\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> is closed under arbitrary unions.</div>
