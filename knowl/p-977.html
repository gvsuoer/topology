<div class="para">A sequence <span class="process-math">\((a_n)\)</span> of real numbers converges to a number <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> if we can make all of the numbers in the sequence as close to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we like by choosing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to be large enough. Once again, this is an informal description that we need to make more rigorous. As we saw with continuous functions, we can make more rigorous the idea of “closeness” by introducing a symbol for a number that can be arbitrarily small. So we can say that the numbers <span class="process-math">\(a_n\)</span> can get as close to a number <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we want if we can make <span class="process-math">\(| a_n - L | \lt \epsilon\)</span> for any positive number <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\text{.}\)</span> The idea of choosing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> large enough is just finding a large enough fixed integer <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(| a_n - L | \lt \epsilon\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(n \geq N\text{.}\)</span> This leads to the definition.</div>
