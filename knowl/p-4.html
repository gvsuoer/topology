<div class="para">Over many years I have taught topology I developed pre- and in-class activities that I used to supplement the texts I had adopted. Eventually I had enough material to eliminate the reliance on outside texts and could rely on the activities. This book is built on those activities and is intended as a one semester introduction to point-set topology. The emphasis for this book is to have students be active learners and to help develop their intuition through working activities and examples. Although it is difficult to capture the essence of active learning in a textbook, this book is an attempt to do just that.</div>
