<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\((X,d)\)</span> be a metric space. We have seen that it is possible for a subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to be both open and closed. There is a characterization of sets that are both open and closed in terms of their boundaries. Find and prove such a characterization. (Your statement should have the form: A subset <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> of a metric space <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is both open and closed if and only if the boundary of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\underline{}\text{.}\)</span>)</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_closed_set_exer.html#exercise-104" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
