<div class="para">To help students develop their communication skills in mathematics. Students are expected to read and complete activities before class and come prepared with questions. Students regularly work in groups and present their work in class. Outside of class students work pre-class activities that are designed to help review previous material and to prepare them for the discussion of new material. In addition, students also individually write solutions to exercises on which they receive significant feedback. Communication skills are essential in any discipline and a heavy focus is placed on their development.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="act_Preface.html#li-3" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
