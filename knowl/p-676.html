<div class="para">Now we have to address the question of how we “make” the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> to be within <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{.}\)</span> Since the values <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> are the dependent values, dependent on <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we “make” the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> have the property we want by choosing the inputs <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> appropriately. In order for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to be continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\text{,}\)</span> we must be able to find <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values close enough to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> to force <span class="process-math">\(| f(x) - f(a) | \lt \epsilon\text{.}\)</span> Pictorially, we can see how this might happen in the image at right in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Continuity.html" title="Figure 6.1">Figure 6.1</a>. We need to be able to find an interval around <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> so that the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> lies in the <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> band around <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> for values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in that interval. In other words, we need to be able to find some positive number <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> so that if <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is in the interval <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta,
a+\delta)\text{,}\)</span> then the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> lies in the <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> band around <span class="process-math">\(y=f(a)\text{.}\)</span> More formally, if we are given any positive tolerance <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\text{,}\)</span> we must be able to find a positive number <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> so that if <span class="process-math">\(| x-a | \lt \delta\)</span> (that is, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is in the interval <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta, a+\delta)\)</span>), then <span class="process-math">\(| f(x) - f(a) | \lt \epsilon\)</span> (or <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> lies in the <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\)</span> band around <span class="process-math">\(y=f(a)\)</span>).</div>
