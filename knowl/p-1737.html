<div class="para">Metric equivalence is a very strong type of equivalence — the existence of an isometry does not allow for much flexibility since distances must be preserved. From a topological perspective, we are only concerned about the open sets — there are no distances. The open unit ball in <span class="process-math">\((\R^2, d_E)\)</span> and the open ball in <span class="process-math">\((\R^2, d_M)\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(d_E\)</span> is the Euclidean metric and <span class="process-math">\(d_M\)</span> is the max metric) are not that different as we can see in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Equivalence.html" title="Figure 14.7">Figure 14.7</a>. If we don’t worry about preserving distances, we can stretch the open ball <span class="process-math">\(B_E = B((0,0),1)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((\R^2, d_E)\)</span> along the lines <span class="process-math">\(y=x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y=-x\)</span> uniformly in a way to mold it onto the unit ball <span class="process-math">\(B_M = B((0,0),1)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((\R^2, d_M)\text{.}\)</span> The important thing is that this stretching will preserve the open sets. This is a much more forgiving type of equivalence and maintains the central idea of topology that we have discussed — what properties of a space are not altered by stretching and bending the space. This type of equivalence that allows us to manipulate a space without fundamentally changing the open sets is called <dfn class="terminology">topological equivalence</dfn>.</div>
