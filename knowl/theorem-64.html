<div class="para">We know that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is connected, so it remains to show that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is not path connected. The sets <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> are connected (as continuous images of the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((0,1]\text{,}\)</span> respectively). We will prove that there is no path <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(p(0) = (0,0)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(p(1) =  b\)</span> for any point <span class="process-math">\(b \in S_2\)</span> by contradiction.

</div>
</div> <div class="para">Note that <span class="process-math">\(S_2\)</span> is an open subset of <span class="process-math">\(S\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(S_2 = \left( \bigcup_{z = (x,y) \in S_2} B\left(z, \frac{x}{2}\right)\right) \cap S\text{.}\)</span> So the continuity of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> implies that <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is an open subset of <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span> Also, the fact that <span class="process-math">\(p(0) \in S_1\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(U \neq \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> and the fact that <span class="process-math">\(p(1) \in S_2\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(V \neq \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> If we demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is an open subset of <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{,}\)</span> then Equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq_TSC_1.html" title="Equation 19.2">(19.2)</a> will imply that <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> is not connected, a contradiction.

To simplify our analysis, let us consider the projection onto the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. The function <span class="process-math">\(P_x : \R^2 \to \R\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(P_x(x,y) = x\)</span> is a continuous function. Let <span class="process-math">\(I = P_x(p(B))\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(p(B) \subseteq O\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq P_x(O)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(Z = P_x(O)\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq Z\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is a connected set (<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is an interval), we know that <span class="process-math">\(p(B)\)</span> is a connected set. The fact that <span class="process-math">\(P_x\)</span> is continuous means that <span class="process-math">\(I = P_x(p(B))\)</span> is connected as well. Now <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is a bounded subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> must be a bounded interval. Recall that <span class="process-math">\(x \in B\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(p(x) \in p(B)\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(p(x) \in S_1\)</span> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(0 = P_x(p(x)) \in P_x(p(B)) = I\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(I \neq \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> There are two possibilities for <span class="process-math">\(I\text{:}\)</span> either <span class="process-math">\(I = \{0\}\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is an interval of positive length. We consider the cases.</div> <div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(I = \{0\}\text{.}\)</span> Then the projection of <span class="process-math">\(p(B)\)</span> onto the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis is the single point <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p(B) \subseteq S_1\)</span> as desired. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is an interval of the form <span class="process-math">\([0,d]\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\([0,d)\)</span> for some positive number <span class="process-math">\(d\text{.}\)</span> The structure of <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> would indicate that there must be some gaps in the set <span class="process-math">\(Z\text{,}\)</span> the projection of <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> onto the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. This implies that <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> cannot be a connected interval. We proceed to show this. In other words, we will prove that <span class="process-math">\(I \setminus Z \neq \emptyset\)</span> (which is impossible since <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq Z\)</span>). Remember that <span class="process-math">\(p(x) \in S_1\text{,}\)</span> so let <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = (0, q)\text{.}\)</span> We consider what happens if <span class="process-math">\(q \lt \frac{1}{2}\)</span> and when <span class="process-math">\(q \geq \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(q \lt \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Then the ball <span class="process-math">\(B_S\left(p(x), \frac{1}{2}\right)\)</span> contains only points with <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> value less than 1. Let <span class="process-math">\(N \in \Z^+\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(t=\frac{1}{\pi/2+2N\pi} \lt d\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(t \in I\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(\frac{1}{t}\right) = \sin(\pi/2 + 2N\pi) = \sin(\pi/2) = 1\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(\left(t,\sin\left(\frac{1}{t}\right)\right)\)</span> is not in <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(t \notin Z\text{.}\)</span> Thus we have found a point in <span class="process-math">\(I \setminus Z\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">Finally, suppose <span class="process-math">\(q \geq \frac{1}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Then the ball <span class="process-math">\(B_S\left(p(x), \frac{1}{2}\right)\)</span> contains only points with <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> value greater than <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(N \in \Z^+\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(t=\frac{1}{3\pi/2+2N\pi} \lt d\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(t \in I\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(\sin\left(\frac{1}{t}\right) = \sin(3\pi/2 + 2N\pi) = \sin(3\pi/2) = -1\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(t \notin Z\text{.}\)</span> Thus we have found a point in <span class="process-math">\(I \setminus Z\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We conclude that there can be no path in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> to any point in <span class="process-math">\(S_2\text{,}\)</span> completing our proof that <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is not path connected. (In fact, the argument given shows that there is no path in <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> from any point in <span class="process-math">\(S_1\)</span> to any point in <span class="process-math">\(S_2\text{.}\)</span>
