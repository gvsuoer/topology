<div class="para">It can be difficult to completely describe the open sets in a topology. Instead, we can describe the topology using a collection of sets that generate the topology. For example, if <span class="process-math">\((X,d)\)</span> is a metric space then the collection of open sets in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> forms a topology on <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> called the <dfn class="terminology">metric</dfn> topology. We also saw that in a metric space, every open set in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a union of open balls. For that reason we called the collection of open balls a <dfn class="terminology">basis</dfn> for the open sets in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> We can do the same thing in any topological space. As a non-trivial example, an interesting topology defined on the positive integers is due to S.W. Golomb. One can use this topology to prove that there are infinitely many primes. This topology also makes the positive integers into a connected Hausdorff space (more on these concepts later). The Golomb topology is defined as follows. If <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are coprime integers in <span class="process-math">\(\Z^+\)</span> (that is, <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> have no common positive factors other than 1 so that the greatest common divisor of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>), let</div>
