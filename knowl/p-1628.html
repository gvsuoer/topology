<div class="para">It is the case that every <span class="process-math">\(T_4\)</span>-space is <span class="process-math">\(T_3\text{,}\)</span> every <span class="process-math">\(T_3\)</span>-space is <span class="process-math">\(T_2\text{,}\)</span> and every <span class="process-math">\(T_2\)</span>-space is <span class="process-math">\(T_1\text{.}\)</span> Verification of these statements are left to <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_T_1_2_3.html" title="Exercise 18">Exercise 18</a>. These properties are also all different. That is, there are <span class="process-math">\(T_1\)</span>-spaces that are not <span class="process-math">\(T_2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T_2\)</span>-spaces that are not <span class="process-math">\(T_3\text{.}\)</span> These problems are given in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ex_not_T_1_2_3.html" title="Exercise 19">Exercise 19</a>. The fact that there are <span class="process-math">\(T_3\)</span>-spaces that are not <span class="process-math">\(T_4\)</span> is a bit difficult. An example is the <dfn class="terminology">Niemytzki plane</dfn>. The Niemytzki plane is the upper half plane <span class="process-math">\(X = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid y \geq 0\}\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> be the boundary of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(L = \{(x,y) \in \R^2 \mid y = 0\}\text{.}\)</span> A basis for the topology on <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> consists of the standard open disks centered at points with <span class="process-math">\(y \gt 0\)</span> along with the open disks in <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus L\)</span> that are tangent to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> together with their points of tangency. We won’t verify that the Niemytzki plane is <span class="process-math">\(T_3\)</span> but not <span class="process-math">\(T_4\text{.}\)</span> The interested reader can find an accessible proof in the article “Another Proof that the Niemytzki Plane is not Normal” by David H. Vetterlein in the <span class="booktitle">Pi Mu Epsilon Journal</span>, Vol. 10, No. 2 (SPRING 1995), pp. 119-121.</div>
