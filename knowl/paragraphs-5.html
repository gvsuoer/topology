<section class="paragraphs"><h1 class="heading"><span class="title">To the Instructor.</span></h1> <div class="para">While this text is intended as a one semester introduction to point-set topology, there is more material in the text than my students have been able to comfortably digest in a single semester. With that in mind, some care should be taken to ensure that what you feel are the most important topics are ones that are discussed. As mentioned earlier, I think students really benefit from a thorough review and discussion of sets and functions in the first two sections. From there, the sections build on each other. However, one can omit <a href="chap_metric_spaces_apps.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: Applications of Metric Spaces">Chapter 4</a> on Applications of Metric Spaces without loss of continuity. My goal for a single semester course is to be sure that we can investigate compactness and connectedness. With this in mind, it is possible to omit <a href="chap_quotients.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 16: Quotient Spaces">Chapter 16</a> on quotient spaces if time is tight.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="act_Preface.html#paragraphs-5" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
