<div class="para">We defined connectedness in terms of separability by open sets. There are other ways to look at connectedness. For example, the subset <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> is connected in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> because we can draw a line segment (which we will call a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>) between any two points in <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> and remain in the set <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{.}\)</span> So we might alternatively consider a topological space to be connected if there is always a path from one point in the spaced to another. Although this is a new notion of connectedness, we will see that path connectedness and connectedness are related.</div>
