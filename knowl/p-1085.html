<div class="para">Every interval of the form <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> is a closed set using the Euclidean metric. What distinguishes these closed intervals from the open intervals is that the open intervals do not contain either of their endpoints — this is what makes an open interval a neighborhood of each of its points. In general, what makes open sets open is that they do not contain their boundaries. If an open set doesn’t contain its boundary, then its complement, by contrast, should contain its boundary. This leads to the definition of a closed set.</div>
