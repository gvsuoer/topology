<div class="para">Define a continuous surjection <span class="process-math">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> that respects the relation. That is, we need to ensure that <span class="process-math">\(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(x_1 \sim x_2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> We saw earlier that the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = (\cos(2 \pi t), \sin(2 \pi t))\)</span> respects the relation. Since every point on the unit circle is of the form <span class="process-math">\((\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\)</span> for some real number <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> choosing <span class="process-math">\(t = \frac{\theta}{2 \pi}\)</span> makes <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a surjection. Now we need to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous. A collection of basic open sets in <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> can be found by intersecting <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> with open balls in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_S_1_basis.html" title="Figure 16.11">FigureÂ 16.11</a>. We can see that the basic open sets are arcs of the form <span class="process-math">\(\overparen{ab}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S^1\text{.}\)</span> Suppose <span class="process-math">\(a = (\cos(2 \pi A), \sin(2 \pi A))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = (\cos(2 \pi B), \sin(2 \pi B))\)</span> for angles <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\overparen{ab})\)</span> is the union of intervals <span class="process-math">\((A+2\pi k, B+2 \pi k)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(k \in \Z\text{.}\)</span> As a union of open intervals, we have that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\overparen{ab})\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> We have now found a continuous surjection from <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> that respects the relation.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_find_quotient_space.html#li-311" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
