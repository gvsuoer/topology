<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\((X, d_X)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((Y,d_Y)\)</span> be metric spaces, and let <span class="process-math">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> be a function. To prove this biconditional statement we need to prove both implications. First assume that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at some point <span class="process-math">\(a \in X\text{.}\)</span> We will show that for any neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{,}\)</span> its inverse image <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(N)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> be a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> To demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(N)\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> we need to find an open ball around <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> that is contained in <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(N)\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(N\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{,}\)</span> by definition there exists <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon \gt 0\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(B(f(a), \epsilon) \subseteq N\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> there exists <span class="process-math">\(\delta \gt 0\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(B(a, \delta) \subseteq f^{-1}\left(B(f(a), \epsilon)\right)\text{.}\)</span> So if <span class="process-math">\(x \in B(a, \delta)\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f(x) \in B(f(a), \epsilon) \subseteq N\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(B(a, \delta) \subseteq f^{-1}(N)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(N)\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
