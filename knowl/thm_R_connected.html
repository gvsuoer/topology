</div> <div class="para">Suppose <span class="process-math">\(x \in U\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is an open set implies that there exists <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon \gt 0\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq U\text{.}\)</span> But then <span class="process-math">\(B(x, \epsilon) \cap V = \emptyset\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(d(x,v) \geq \epsilon\)</span> for every <span class="process-math">\(v \in V\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(x+\epsilon \lt v\)</span> for every <span class="process-math">\(v \in V'\text{,}\)</span> contradicting the fact that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the greatest lower bound.
