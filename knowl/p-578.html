<div class="para"> A greatest lower bound is also called an <dfn class="terminology">infimum</dfn>. We might now use this idea of a greatest lower bound to define the distance between <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A = (-1,0)\)</span> as the greatest lower bound of the set <span class="process-math">\(\{d_E(1,a) \mid a \in (-1,0)\}\text{.}\)</span> However, there are questions we need to address before we can do so. One question is whether or not every nonempty subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> that is bounded below has an infimum. The answer to this question is yes, and we will take this result as an axiom of the real number system (often called the <dfn class="terminology">completeness axiom</dfn>).</div>
