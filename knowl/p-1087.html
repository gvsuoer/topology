<div class="para">We said that open sets are open because they do not contain their boundary and closed sets are closed because they do contain their boundary. However, we did not define what we mean by boundary. The point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> on the “boundary” of an open interval of the form <span class="process-math">\(O=(a,b)\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with the Euclidean metric has the property that every open ball that contains <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> contains points in <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> and points not in <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> This is what makes the point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> lie on the boundary. We can also think of the point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> as being at the very limit of the set <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> This motivates the next definition.</div>
