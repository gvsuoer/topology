<div class="para">Connectedness is an important property, and one that we encounter in the calculus. For example, we will see in this section that the Intermediate Value Theorem relies on connected subsets of <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> To define a connected set, we will need to have a way to understand when and how a set can be separated into different pieces. Since a topology is defined by open sets, when we want to separate objects we will do so with open sets. This is similar to the idea behind Hausdorff spaces, except that we now want to know if a set can be separated in some way rather than separating points.</div>
