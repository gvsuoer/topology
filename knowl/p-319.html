<div class="para">How big is a set? When a set is finite, we can count the number of elements in the set and answer the question directly. When a set is infinite, the question is a little more complicated. For example, how big is <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{?}\)</span> How big is <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{?}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> is a subset of <span class="process-math">\(\Q\text{,}\)</span> we might think that <span class="process-math">\(\Q\)</span> contains more elements than <span class="process-math">\(\Z\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(\Z\)</span> is infinite and how many more elements can we have than infinity? We wonâ€™t answer that question in this section, but it is an interesting one to consider.</div>
