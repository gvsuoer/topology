Let <span class="process-math">\(x \in O\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x \in O_k\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(1 \leq k \leq n\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> be between 1 and <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(O_k\)</span> is open, we know that <span class="process-math">\(O_k\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of its points. So there exists <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon_k \gt 0\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(B(x, \epsilon_k) \subseteq O_k\text{.}\)</span> Since there are only finitely many values of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon = \min\{\epsilon_k \mid 1 \leq k \leq n\}\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq B(x, \epsilon_k)\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(B(x, \epsilon) \subseteq \bigcap_{k=1}^n O_k = O\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of its points and <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is an open set.</div>
