<dd><div class="para">Define a continuous surjection <span class="process-math">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> that respects the relation. That is, we need to ensure that <span class="process-math">\(f(x_1) = f(x_2)\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(x_1 \sim x_2\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> We saw earlier that the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = (\cos(2 \pi t), \sin(2 \pi t))\)</span> respects the relation. Since every point on the unit circle is of the form <span class="process-math">\((\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\)</span> for some real number <span class="process-math">\(\theta\text{,}\)</span> choosing <span class="process-math">\(t = \frac{\theta}{2 \pi}\)</span> makes <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = (\cos(\theta), \sin(\theta))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a surjection. Now we need to demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous. A collection of basic open sets in <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> can be found by intersecting <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> with open balls in <span class="process-math">\(\R^2\)</span> as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_S_1_basis.html" title="Figure 8.11">Figure 8.11</a>. We can see that the basic open sets are arcs of the form <span class="process-math">\(\wideparen{ab}\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(S^1\text{.}\)</span> Suppose <span class="process-math">\(a = (\cos(2 \pi A), \sin(2 \pi A))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b = (\cos(2 \pi B), \sin(2 \pi B))\)</span> for angles <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\wideparen{ab})\)</span> is the union of intervals <span class="process-math">\((A+2\pi k, B+2 \pi k)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(k \in \Z\text{.}\)</span> As a union of open intervals, we have that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(\wideparen{ab})\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> We have now found a continuous surjection from <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> that respects the relation.</div></dd>

<dd><div class="para">Find a continuous function from <span class="process-math">\(X/\ssim\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/thm_quotient_2.html" title="Theorem 8.9">Theorem 8.9</a> tells us that the function <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f} : (X/\ssim) \to Y\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}([t]) = f(t)\)</span> is continuous. So <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is our candidate to be a homeomorphism.</div></dd>
<dt>Step 3</dt>
<dd><div class="para">Show that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is a bijection. Let <span class="process-math">\(y \in Y\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a surjection means that there is a <span class="process-math">\(t \in \R\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(t) = y\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}([t]) = f(t) = y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is a surjection. To demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is an injection, suppose <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}([s]) = \overline{f}([t])\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(s,
t \in \R\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\((\cos(2 \pi s), \sin(2 \pi s)) = f(s) = f(t) = (\cos(2\pi t), \sin(2 \pi t))\text{.}\)</span> It must be the case then that <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi s\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi t\)</span> differ by a multiple of <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(2 \pi s - 2 \pi t = 2 \pi k\)</span> for some integer <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span> From this we have <span class="process-math">\(s - t = k \in \Z\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(s \sim t\text{.}\)</span> This makes <span class="process-math">\([s] = [t]\)</span> and we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is an injection.</div></dd>
<dt>Step 4</dt>
<dd><div class="para">Show that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is a homeomorphism. At this point we already know that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is a continuous bijection, so the only item that remains is to show that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}(\overline{O})\)</span> is open whenever <span class="process-math">\(\overline{O}\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X/\ssim\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(p: X \to (X/\ssim)\)</span> be the standard map.

Let <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\)</span> be an interval contained in <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> From the definition of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> we have that <span class="process-math">\(f(a,b)\)</span> is the open arc <span class="process-math">\(\wideparen{f(a)f(b)}\text{,}\)</span> which is open in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(f(O)\)</span> is a union of open arcs in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{,}\)</span> which makes <span class="process-math">\(f(O)\)</span> open in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> Now <span class="process-math">\(f(O) = (\overline{f} \circ p)(O) = \overline{f}(p(O)) = \overline{f}(\overline{O})\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}(\overline{O})\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is a homeomorphism from <span class="process-math">\(X/\ssim\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(S^1\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(S^1\)</span> is a quotient space of <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span>
