<div class="para">Recall that the continuity of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> from a metric space <span class="process-math">\((X, d_X)\)</span> to a metric space <span class="process-math">\((Y, d_Y)\)</span> at a point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is defined in terms of sets of points <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(d_X(x,a) \lt \delta\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y \in Y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(d_Y(y, f(a)) \lt \epsilon\)</span> for positive real numbers <span class="process-math">\(\delta\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\epsilon\text{.}\)</span> In <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with the Euclidean metric <span class="process-math">\(d_E\text{,}\)</span> for real numbers <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> the set of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values satisfying <span class="process-math">\(d_E(x,a) \lt \delta\)</span> is the set of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> values so that <span class="process-math">\(| x-a | \lt \delta\text{.}\)</span> We often write this set in interval notation as <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta,
a+\delta)\)</span> and call <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta,
a+\delta)\)</span> an open interval. An informal reason that we call such an interval open (as opposed to the intervals <span class="process-math">\([a-\delta,
a+\delta)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta, a+\delta]\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\([a-\delta,
a+\delta]\)</span>) is that the open interval does not contain either of its endpoints. A more substantial reason to call such an interval open is that if <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> is any element in <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta,
a+\delta)\text{,}\)</span> then we can find another open interval around <span class="process-math">\(x'\)</span> that is completely contained in the interval <span class="process-math">\((a-\delta,
a+\delta)\text{.}\)</span> So you could naively think of an open interval as one in which there is enough room in the interval for any point in the interval to wiggle around a bit and stay within the interval.</div>
