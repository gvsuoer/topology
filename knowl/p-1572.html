<div class="para">For the converse, assume that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> contains all of its limit points. To show that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed, we prove that <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus C\)</span> is open. We again proceed by contradiction and assume that <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus C\)</span> is not open. Then there exists <span class="process-math">\(x \in X \setminus C\)</span> such that no neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is entirely contained in <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus C\text{.}\)</span> This implies that every neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> contains a point in <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a limit point of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> It follows that <span class="process-math">\(x \in C\text{,}\)</span> contradicting the fact that <span class="process-math">\(x \in X \setminus C\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus C\)</span> is open and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed.</div>
