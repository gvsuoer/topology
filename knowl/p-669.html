<div class="para">This involved providing some explanation about what it means for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> to have a limit at a point. Intuitively, the idea is that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> if we can make all of the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as close to (but not equal to) <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> as we need. To extend this informal notion of limit to continuity at a point we would say that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at a point <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> if if we can make all of the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> as we need (now <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> can equal <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>).</div>
