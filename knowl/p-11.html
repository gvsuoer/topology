<div class="para">The in-class activities engage students in common intellectual experiences. These activities are used to provide motivation for the material, opportunities for students to prove substantial course material on their own, or examples to help reinforce the meanings of definitions or theorems and their proofs. The ultimate goal is to help students develop their intuition for and understanding of abstract concepts. Students often complete these in-class activities, then present their results to the entire class.</div>
