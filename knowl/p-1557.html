<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> be a topological space, and let <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> be a subset of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> First we assume that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed and show that <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> contains all of its limit points. Let <span class="process-math">\(x \in X\)</span> be a limit point of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> We proceed by contradiction and assume that <span class="process-math">\(x \notin C\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(x \in X \setminus C\text{,}\)</span> which is an open set. This means that there is a neighborhood (namely <span class="process-math">\(X \setminus C\)</span>) of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that contains no points in <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> which contradicts the fact that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a limit point of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(x \in C\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> contains all of its limit points.</div>
