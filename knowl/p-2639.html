<div class="para">Cover the set <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> with open sets that are contained in <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> is open, we can intersect any open set with <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> and still have an open set). Each open set is a union of basis elements, so we can cover <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> with basis elements <span class="process-math">\(U \times V\)</span> that are contained in <span class="process-math">\(N_a\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> is compact, there is a finite collection <span class="process-math">\(U_1 \times V_1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(U_2 \times V_2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(U_m \times V_m\)</span> of basis elements contained in <span class="process-math">\(N_a\)</span> that cover <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\text{.}\)</span> Assume that each <span class="process-math">\(U_i \times V_i\)</span> intersects <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\)</span> (otherwise, we can remove that set and still have a cover). Let <span class="process-math">\(W_a = U_1 \cap U_2 \cap \cdots \cap U_m\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(a \in U_i\)</span> for each <span class="process-math">\(i\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is not empty. Each <span class="process-math">\(U_i\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(W_a\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Now we demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y \subseteq \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq m} U_i \times V_i\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \in W_a \times Y\text{.}\)</span> Since the collection <span class="process-math">\(\{U_i \times V_i\}_{1 \leq i \leq m}\)</span> covers <span class="process-math">\(Y_a\text{,}\)</span> the point <span class="process-math">\((a,y)\)</span> is in <span class="process-math">\(U_k \times V_k\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> between <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(y \in Y_k\text{.}\)</span> But <span class="process-math">\(x \in W_a = \bigcap_{1 \leq i \leq m} U_i\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x \in U_k\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \in U_k \times V_k\)</span> and we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(W_a \times Y \subseteq \bigcup_{1 \leq i \leq m} U_i \times V_i\text{.}\)</span>
