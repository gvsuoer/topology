<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\((X, d_X)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((Y,d_Y)\)</span> be metric spaces, and let <span class="process-math">\(f : X \to Y\)</span> be a function. To prove this biconditional statement we need to prove both implications. First assume that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a continuous function. We must show that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is an open set in <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> for every open set <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> So let <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> be an open set in <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> To demonstrate that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{,}\)</span> we will show that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of its points. Let <span class="process-math">\(a \in f^{-1}(O)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f(a) \in O\text{.}\)</span> Now <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is an open set, so there is an open ball <span class="process-math">\(B(f(a), \epsilon)\)</span> around <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> that is entirely contained in <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(B(f(a), \epsilon)\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(B(f(a), \epsilon))\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Thus, there exists <span class="process-math">\(\delta \gt 0\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(B(a, \delta) \subseteq f^{-1}(B(f(a), \epsilon))\text{.}\)</span> Now <span class="process-math">\(f(B(a, \delta)) \subseteq B(f(a), \epsilon) \subseteq O\text{,}\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(B(a, \delta) \subseteq f^{-1}(O)\text{.}\)</span> We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of its points and is therefore an open set in <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span>
