<div class="para">Every element in <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is mapped into <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> by the path <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is complicated, consisting of infinitely many sub-curves of the curve <span class="process-math">\(S_2\text{,}\)</span> along with points in <span class="process-math">\(S_1\text{,}\)</span> as illustrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_TSC_O.html" title="Figure 19.18">FigureÂ 19.18</a>. To simplify our analysis, let us consider the projection onto the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis. The function <span class="process-math">\(P_x : \R^2 \to \R\)</span> defined by <span class="process-math">\(P_x(x,y) = x\)</span> is a continuous function. Let <span class="process-math">\(I = P_x(p(B))\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(p(B) \subseteq O\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq P_x(O)\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(Z = P_x(O)\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(I \subseteq Z\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is a connected set (<span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> is an interval), we know that <span class="process-math">\(p(B)\)</span> is a connected set. The fact that <span class="process-math">\(P_x\)</span> is continuous means that <span class="process-math">\(I = P_x(p(B))\)</span> is connected as well. Now <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is a bounded subset of <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> must be a bounded interval. Recall that <span class="process-math">\(x \in B\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(p(x) \in p(B)\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(p(x) \in S_1\)</span> tells us that <span class="process-math">\(0 = P_x(p(x)) \in P_x(p(B)) = I\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(I \neq \emptyset\text{.}\)</span> There are two possibilities for <span class="process-math">\(I\text{:}\)</span> either <span class="process-math">\(I = \{0\}\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> is an interval of positive length. We consider the cases.</div>
