<div class="para">Now we will examine how continuity can be described in terms of sequences. The basic idea is this. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(f : \R \to \R\)</span> is continuous at a point <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> This means that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit (as a continuous function) at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> So if we were to take any sequence <span class="process-math">\((a_n)\)</span> that converges to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> then the continuity of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> implies that <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = f(\lim a_n) = \lim f(a_n)\text{.}\)</span> That this is both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for continuity is given in the next theorem.</div>
