<div class="para">As an example to motivate the definition, consider the sets <span class="process-math">\(X = (0,1) \cup (1,2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y = [1,2]\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> with the Euclidean topology. Notice that we can write <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> as the union of two disjoint open sets <span class="process-math">\(X_1 = (0,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(X_2 = (1,2)\text{.}\)</span> So we shouldnâ€™t think of <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> as being connected. However, if we attempt to write <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> as a union of two subsets, say <span class="process-math">\(Y_1 = [1,1.5)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y_2 = [1.5,2]\text{,}\)</span> it is impossible for both of these subsets to be open and disjoint. So <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> is a set we should consider to be connected. This is the notion of connectedness that we wish to investigate.</div>
