<div class="para"> In the case that <span class="process-math">\(A = \emptyset\text{,}\)</span> we say that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has <dfn class="terminology">cardinality</dfn> <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> and if there is a bijection from <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to the set <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2, \ldots,
n\}\text{,}\)</span> we say that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has cardinality <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> If there is no positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> such that there is a bijection from set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2, \ldots,
n\}\)</span> we say that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is an <dfn class="terminology">infinite</dfn> set and say that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> has infinite cardinality. We use the word <dfn class="terminology">cardinality</dfn> instead of number of elements because we canâ€™t actually count the number of elements in an infinite set. We denote the cardinality of the set (the number of elements in the set) <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by <span class="process-math">\(|A|\text{.}\)</span> It is left to the homework to show that if <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> are sets with <span class="process-math">\(|A|=n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(|B| = m\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(n=m\)</span> if and only if there is a bijection <span class="process-math">\(f: A \to B\text{.}\)</span> This tells us that cardinality is well defined. Since composites of bijections are bijections with inverses that are bijections, if there is a bijection from set <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2, \ldots,
n\}\)</span> and a bijection from a set <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2, \ldots,
n\}\)</span> for some positive integer <span class="process-math">\(n\text{,}\)</span> then there is a bijection between <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B\text{.}\)</span> Using this idea, we say that two sets (either finite or infinite) have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between the sets. We will discuss cardinality in more detail a bit later.</div>
