I made this textbook available to everyone for free download for their own non-commercial use. It could be especially useful for instructors who are looking for an inquiry-based textbook, as a supplemental resource to accompany their course, or for someone interested in learning some topology on their own. If an instructor would like to make changes to any of the files to better suit their students’ needs, source files for the text are available by making a request to the author.</div> <div class="para">This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
