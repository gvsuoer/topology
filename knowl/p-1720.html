Let <span class="process-math">\(a \in f^{-1}(O)\text{.}\)</span> Then <span class="process-math">\(f(a) \in O\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is an open set, <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous means that <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is a neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of its points and <span class="process-math">\(f^{-1}(O)\)</span> is an open set.</div>
