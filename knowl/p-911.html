<div class="para">Open sets can be characterized in terms of their interior points. By definition, every open set is a neighborhood of each of its points, so every point of an open set <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is an interior point of <span class="process-math">\(O\text{.}\)</span> Conversely, if every point of a set <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is an interior point, then <span class="process-math">\(O\)</span> is a neighborhood of each of its points and is open. This argument is summarized in the next theorem.</div>
