Goals  Over many years I have taught topology I developed pre- and in-class activities that I used to supplement the texts I had adopted. Eventually I had enough material to eliminate the reliance on outside texts and could rely on the activities. This book is built on those activities and is intended as a one semester introduction to point-set topology. The emphasis for this book is to have students be active learners and to help develop their intuition through working activities and examples. Although it is difficult to capture the essence of active learning in a textbook, this book is an attempt to do just that.  The goals for these materials are several.   To carefully introduce the ideas behind the definitions and theorems to help students develop intuition and understand the logic behind them.    To help students understand that mathematics is not done as it is often presented. I expect students to experiment through examples, make conjectures, and then refine or prove their conjectures. I believe it is important for students to learn that definitions and theorems don't pop up completely formed in the minds of most mathematicians but are the result of much thought and work.    To help students develop their communication skills in mathematics. Students are expected to read and complete activities before class and come prepared with questions. Students regularly work in groups and present their work in class. Outside of class students work pre-class activities that are designed to help review previous material and to prepare them for the discussion of new material. In addition, students also individually write solutions to exercises on which they receive significant feedback. Communication skills are essential in any discipline and a heavy focus is placed on their development.       Layout  Each section of the book contains preview activities, in-class activities, and exercises. The various types of activities serve different purposes.   Preview activities are designed for students to complete before class to motivate the upcoming topic and prepare them with the background and information they need for the class activities and discussion.    The in-class activities engage students in common intellectual experiences. These activities are used to provide motivation for the material, opportunities for students to prove substantial course material on their own, or examples to help reinforce the meanings of definitions or theorems and their proofs. The ultimate goal is to help students develop their intuition for and understanding of abstract concepts. Students often complete these in-class activities, then present their results to the entire class.     Each section contains a collection of exercises. The exercises occur at a variety of levels of difficulty and most force students to extend their knowledge in different ways. While there are some standard, classic problems that are included in the exercises, many problems are open ended and expect a student to develop and then verify conjectures.    Organization  This text begins by formally introducing sets and functions. Although these topics are familiar to students, it is my experience that the level of understanding of sets and functions for most students is not yet sufficiently deep enough to ensure success with functions throughout the course. focuses on metric spaces. It is my belief and my experience that students better understand the abstract concepts of neighborhoods, open sets, continuity, etc., if they are first experienced in a more familiar, concrete context like metric spaces. Metric spaces are easier for students to grasp than general topological spaces as they provide a notion of distance that is comforting to students. Metric spaces also allow one to introduce and motivate important topological concepts in a more familiar context. For example, by first encountering continuity of functions in a metric space setting, and revisiting the idea from different perspectives, the definition of continuity in the more abstract setting of topological spaces seems more accessible and natural. This perspective was also noted by Felix Hausdorff, who is considered as one of the founders of modern topology. His text Grundz√ºge der Mengenlehre (Fundamentals of Set Theory) (Felix Hausdorff, Leipzig, Von Veit, 1914. Translated to English as Set Theory by John R. Aumann et al, New York, Chelsea PublishingCompany, 1957) provided one of the first systematic treatments of topological spaces. As Hausdorff writes (p. 210) concerning the introduction of the concepts of topology following topics of basic set theory,   A quite generally worded theory of this nature would of course cause considerable complications, and deliver few positive results. But among the special examples that occupy a heightened interest belongs, apart from the theory of a [totally] ordered sets, especially the theory of point-sets in space, in fact here the foundational relationship is again a function of pairs of elements, namely the distance between two points: a function which however now is capable of infinitely many values.     To the Instructor  While this text is intended as a one semester introduction to point-set topology, there is more material in the text than my students have been able to comfortably digest in a single semester. With that in mind, some care should be taken to ensure that what you feel are the most important topics are ones that are discussed. As mentioned earlier, I think students really benefit from a thorough review and discussion of sets and functions in the first two sections. From there, the sections build on each other. However, one can omit on Applications of Metric Spaces without loss of continuity. My goal for a single semester course is to be sure that we can investigate compactness and connectedness. With this in mind, it is possible to omit on quotient spaces if time is tight.    Acknowledgments  The Grand Valley Steve University libraries provided a grant to support my colleagues, John Golden and Clark Wells, to review a draft version of this text. Their thorough reading and comments on the draft have made for a much better book. I am also indebted to my students who have all been test subjects for earlier versions of this material. Without their hard work and suggestions, this book would not exist.    To the Student  I have endeavored to keep the prerequisite material to a minimum for this text. The first two sections discuss sets and functions. Most of this material should be review for the reader, but the importance of these ideas in the subsequent sections makes it a good idea to spend time on these sections. That being said, it will be very helpful for the reader to have some background in reading and writing mathematical proofs.  The objectives of this book and its inquiry-based format place the responsibility of learning the material where it belongs on your shoulders. It is imperative that you engage in the material by completing the preview activities and the in-class activities in order to develop your intuition and understanding of the material. If you do this, and ask questions when you have them, your probability of success will be greatly enhanced. Good luck!   "

  "body": " Introduction  At its most basic level topology deals with sets and how we can deform sets into other sets. So to start our study of topology, we begin with sets. Much of this material should be familiar, but some might be new. The first issue for us to settle on is as precise a definition of set as possible.    Suppose we try to define a set to be a collection of elements. So, by definition, the elements are the objects contained in the set. We use the symbol to denote that an object is an element of a set. So means an object is not in the set if is an object in a set we write , and if is not an object in a set we write . We write sets using set brackets. For example, the set is the set whose elements are the symbols , , and . We can also include in the set notation conditions on elements of the set. For example, is the set of positive real numbers. We typically use capital letters to denote sets. Some familiar examples of sets are , the set of real numbers; , the set of rational numbers; and , the set of integers. Sets can also contain sets as elements. For example, the power set of a set is the set of subsets of . So the power set of is the set . (We will define subsets and the empty set later in this activity).    Consider the following set  , which is a collection of objects: .

  "title": "The Basic Idea of Topology",
  "body": " The Basic Idea of Topology  If you like geometry, you will probably like topology. Geometry is the study of objects with certain attributes (e.g., shape and size), while topology is more general than geometry. In topology, we aren't concerned about the attributes (shape and size) of an object, only about those characteristics that don't change when we transform the object in different ways (any way that doesn't involve tearing or poking holes the object). There are lots of really interesting theorems in topology for example, the Hairy Ball Theorem which states that if you have a ball with hair all over it (think of a tribble from Star Trek if that isn't too old of a reference), it is impossible to comb the hairs continuously and have all the hairs lay flat. Some hair must be sticking straight up!    Take a pipe cleaner, a rubber band, or a piece of string and make a square from it. You are allowed to change the square by moving parts of the square without breaking it or lifting it off the surface it is on. To which of the following shapes can you transform your square? Explain.   a circle   the letter S    a five point star   a five-pointed star    the letter D     Now take some play-doh (if you don't have any play-doh, just use your imagination).

  "body": " Intervals  We will begin with one of the most basic type of set we will encounter intervals. The open intervals will be important as they will form a basis for the standard topology on . We are likely familiar with intervals from algebra and calculus, sets like , . To really understand intervals, we will need a rigorous definition.   interval   A subset of is an interval if for all , , and in (allowing for or to be ) with , if and are in , then is in .    With this definition, the set of all real numbers satisfying is an interval that we denote by (it is important to understand the context we also use the notation to denote an ordered pair). The general notation we use for intervals is the following:    ( or could be )     ( could be )     ( could be )     .     In this notation, . Intervals of the form are called open intervals, intervals of the form are called closed intervals, and intervals of the form or are half-open (or half-closed ) intervals. The reason for this terminology should become more clear as we introduce open and closed sets later.  Note that nothing in the definition indicates that we must have in the interval notation. This implies that is an interval. Since there are no real numbers larger than and less than , is an interval. We could also have an interval of the form where is any real number. This means that , and any single point set is an interval. The intervals and for any real number are called degenerate intervals.  One last note about intervals. Some require that be less than in the definition of an interval, with the result that there are no degenerate intervals. This is a matter of debate that we won't get into. In almost all of our work, we will consider only non-degenerate intervals so this won't be an issue for us.  "

  "title": "Unions, Intersections, and Complements of Sets",
  "body": " Unions, Intersections, and Complements of Sets  In mathematics, the collection of points that make up a string or a blob of play-doh as in is represented as a set. Topology is then the study of these sets and what properties of the sets don't change when transformations are applied to the sets. To study topology we will need a solid understanding of sets and different operations on sets.   set What we saw in is what is called a paradox . Our original attempt to define a set led to an impossible situation since both and lead to contradictions. This paradox is called Russell's paradox after Bertrand Russell, although it was apparently known before Russell. The moral of the story is that we need to be careful when making definitions. A set might seem like a simple object, and in our experi‚âàence usually is, but formally defining a set can be problematic. As a result, we won't state a formal definition, but rather take a set to be a collection of objects that doesn't lead to a paradox. The objects are called the elements of the set. (In axiomatic set theory, a set is taken to be an undefined primitive much as a point is undefined in Euclidean geometry.)  In order to effectively work with sets, we need to have an understanding what it means for two sets to be equal.    What should it mean for two sets to be equal? If and are sets, how do we prove that ? (This is question that requires discussion, which is different than a question that only asks for a computation or an example. Activities throughout this text will ask both types of questions.)    Let and . Is ? If yes, prove your answer. If no, prove any containment that you can.    Let and . Is ? If yes, prove your answer. If no, prove any containment that you can.    Let and . Is ? If yes, prove your answer. If no, prove any containment that you can.    Once we have the notion of a set, we can build new sets from existing ones. For example, we define the union, intersection, set difference, and complement of a set as follows.   set union  The union of sets and is the set defined as .    The intersection  set intersection of sets and is the set defined as .    Let and be sets. The set difference  set difference  is the set .    Let be a subset of a set . The complement  set complement of in is the set . The complement of a set in a set is also denoted by , (if the set is understood), , or even .     We can visualize these sets using Venn diagrams. A Venn diagram is a depiction of sets using geometric figures. For example, if is a set containing all other sets of interest (we call the universal set), we can represent as a large container (say a rectangle) with subsets and as smaller containers (say circles), and shade the elements in a given set. The Venn diagrams in depict the sets , , , , , and .   Venn diagrams                         As we have discussed, to prove that two sets and are equal we prove that each is a subset of the other. The next example provides another illustration of the idea.    Let , , and be sets. We will prove that .  To prove this set equality we must prove that and . We start with .  To prove that , we need to demonstrate that every element in is also in . To do this, we select an arbitrary element in and show that this element is in . Let . Then and .

Use the Venn diagrams and the result of (a) to find and prove a relationship between , and .    In we worked with the union and intersection of two sets. There is no reason to restrict these definitions to only two sets, as the next activity illustrates.   indexed family of sets   To define an infinite collection of sets we often use what is called an indexing set . An indexing set allows us to consider a collection of objects that are in one-to-one correspondence with a set like the positive integers, or even the real numbers. When using an indexing set, we generally make a statement such as ``let for be a collection of sets indexed by some set \". The collection is called an indexed family of sets .    The set could be finite. As an example, let for in the set .   What is ? What is ?   How many sets are in the indexed family ?    The indexing set can be infinite. For example, let for in the set (where is the interval consisting of the real numbers such that ). In this case, what is ? What is ? What is ?

List all of the elements in .    If has elements and has elements, how many elements does the set have? Explain.    There is no reason to restrict ourselves to a Cartesian product of just two sets. This is an idea that we have encountered before. The Cartesian product is the standard real plane that we denote as and the Cartesian product is the three-dimensional real space denoted as . If we have an indexed collection of sets, with running through the set of positive integers, then we can define the Cartesian product of the sets as the set of infinite sequences , where for each . We denote this cartesian product as .  The capital pi ( ) is used to represent a product an an analog of the capital sigma ( ) that is used to represent a sum. We will study sequences in more detail later.  To conclude this section we summarize some properties of sets. Many of these properties can be extended to arbitrary collections of sets.

  "body": " Introduction  Many topological properties are defined using continuous functions. We will focus on continuity later for now we review some important concepts related to functions. Much of this should be familiar, but some might be new.  First we present the basic definitions. Much of our previous work has probably been with functions that map from the reals to the reals, but we will be considering functions form a more general perspective. We start with a formal definition of a function.   function   A function  from a nonempty set to a set is a collection of ordered pairs so that   for each there is a pair in , and    if and are in , then .       Note that the first property is an existence property that if then there is an element in that matches up with . This first property also says that every element in is used, or that every element in is paired with an element in , and the element in depends on the element in that is chosen. The second property is a uniqueness one that there is only one element in that is paired with a given element in .  We generally use an alternate notation for a function. If is an element of a function , we write , and in this way we think of as a mapping from the set to the set . We indicate that is a mapping from set to set with the notation .  If maps the element to the element we also use the notation .  There is some familiar terminology and notation associated with functions. Let be a function from a set to a set .   The set is called the domain  function domain of , and we write .    The set is called the codomain  function codomain of , and we write .    The subset of is called the range  function range of , which we denote by .    If , then is the image  image of an element of under . Since each in is paired with a unique , there is only one image of under . That is why it is appropriate to use the work the when referring to the image of an element.    If and for some , then is called a preimage  preimage of an element of . For a given , there may be many different preimages of , no preimages of , or just one preimage of . It can be instructive to construct examples of each situation. The fact that a preimage of an element may not be unique is the reason we use the word a when referring to a preimage.     Knowing the domains and codomains is very important when working with functions, and we will pay a lot of attention to these sets.  We have likely been exposed to one-to-one and onto function in our past mathematical experiences. One-to-one functions (or injections) and onto functions (or surjections) are special types of functions and we present their definitions here.   function injection  function surjection  function bijection   Let be a function from a set to a set .   The function is an injection if, whenever and are in , then . Alternatively, using the function notation, is an injection if implies .    The function is a surjection if, whenever , then there is an so that is in . Alternatively, using the function notation, is a surjection if for each there exists an so that .    The function is a bijection if is both an injection and a surjection.         We often define functions with rules, but functions can also be defined by tables or graphs. We will work with functions defined by rules in this activity. The goal of this activity is to illustrate why the domain and the codomain are just as important as the rule defining the outputs when want to determine if a function is one-to-one and\/or onto. As an example, let . (Note that is the function and is the image of under .) Notice that .  This observation is enough to prove that the function is not an injection since we can see that there exist two different inputs that produce the same output.  Since , we know that for all . This implies that the function is not a surjection. For example, is in the codomain of and for all in the domain of .    We can change the domain of a function so that the function is defined on a subset of the original domain. Such a function is called a restriction.   function restriction   Let be a function from a set to a set and let be a subset of . The restriction of to is the function satisfying .    A notation used for the restriction is also . We also call an extension of . Let be defined by , and let , where is the set of positive real numbers. So has the same codomain as , but a different domain.   Show that is an injection.   Is a surjection? Justify your conclusion.    Let , and let be defined by . Notice that the function uses the same formula as the function and has the same domain as , but has a different codomain than .   Explain why is not an injection.   Is a surjection? Justify your conclusion.    Let . Define by .   Prove or disprove: the function is an injection.   Prove or disprove: the function is a surjection.    In our preview activity, the same mathematical formula was used to determine the outputs for the functions. However:   One of the functions was neither an injection nor a surjection.    One of the functions was not an injection but was a surjection.    One of the functions was an injection but was not a surjection.    One of the functions was both an injection and a surjection.     This illustrates the important fact that whether a function is injective or surjective not only depends on the formula that defines the output of the function but also on the domain and codomain of the function.  An important special function that is always an injection and surjection is the identity function function identity on a set. If is a set, the identity function on is denoted as , and for every .  "

In topology, we generally don't care about any algebraic structure a set might have, so we will move away from sums and products, and focus on compositions of functions.  The basic idea of function composition is that, when possible, the output of a function is used as the input of a function . The resulting function can be referred to as followed by and is called the composite of with . The notation we use is (note the order  is applied first). For example, if , both mapping to , then we can compute as follows: .  In this case, , the output of the function , was used as the input for the function .

In particular, we might want to know whether or not the composite of two injective functions is also an injection. (Of course, we could ask a similar question for surjections.) These questions are explored in the next activity.    Let the sets , , , and be as follows: .    Construct a function that is an injection and a function that is an injection.

In previous mathematics courses, you probably learned that the exponential function (with base ) and the natural logarithm functions are inverses of each other. You may have seen this relationship expressed as follows: For each with and for each ,   if and only if . Notice that is the input and is the output for the natural logarithm function if and only if is the input and is the output for the exponential function. In essence, the inverse function (in this case, the exponential function) reverses the action of the original function (in this case, the natural logarithm function). In terms of ordered pairs (input-output pairs), this means that if is an ordered pair for a function, then is an ordered pair for its inverse. The idea of reversing the roles of the first and second coordinates is the basis for our definition of the inverse of a function.   function inverse   Let be a function. The inverse of , denoted by , is the set of ordered pairs .    Notice that this definition does not state that is a function. Rather, is simply a subset of .

The proof of is outlined in the following activity.     is a biconditional statement, so we need to prove both directions. Let and be nonempty sets, and let .    Assume that is a bijection. We will prove that is a function, that is that satisfies the conditions of .   Let . What property does have that ensures that for some ? What conclusion can we draw about ?

Use the fact that is a function to prove that is a surjection.    In the situation where is a bijection and is a function from to , we can write . In this case, we frequently say that is an invertible function , and we usually do not use the ordered pair representation for either or .

When a set is infinite, the question is a little more complicated. For example, how big is ? How big is ? Since is a subset of , we might think that contains more elements than . But is infinite and how many more elements can we have than infinity? We won't answer that question in this section, but it is an interesting one to consider.  If two finite sets have the same number of elements, then it should seem natural to say that the sets are of the same size. How do we extend this to infinite sets? If two finite sets have the same number of elements, then we can pair each element in one set with exactly one element in the other. This is exactly what a bijection does. So a set with elements can be paired with the set , where is a positive integer. This is how we can define a finite set.   finite set   A set is a finite set if or there is a bijection mapping to the set for some positive integer .     cardinality of a set In the case that , we say that has cardinality  , and if there is a bijection from to the set , we say that has cardinality . If there is no positive integer such that there is a bijection from set to we say that is an infinite set and say that has infinite cardinality. We use the word cardinality instead of number of elements because we can't actually count the number of elements in an infinite set. We denote the cardinality of the set (the number of elements in the set) by . It is left to the homework to show that if and are sets with and , then if and only if there is a bijection . This tells us that cardinality is well defined. Since composites of bijections are bijections with inverses that are bijections, if there is a bijection from set to and a bijection from a set to for some positive integer , then there is a bijection between and . Using this idea, we say that two sets (either finite or infinite) have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between the sets. We will discuss cardinality in more detail a bit later.  "

In our preview activity we saw that the function satisfies many of the same properties as . These properties allow us to use or as distance functions. We call any distance function a metric , and any space on which a metric is defined is called a metric space .   metric   A metric on a space is a function that satisfies the properties:    for all ,     if and only if in ,     for all , and     for all .       Properties 1 and 2 of a metric say that a metric is positive definite , while property 3 states that a metric is symmetric . Property 4 of the definition is usually the most difficult property to verify for a metric and is called the triangle inequality . triangle inequality    metric space   A metric space is a pair , where is a metric on the space .    When the metric is clear from the context, we just refer to as the metric space.    For each of the following, determine if is a metric space. If is a metric space, explain why. If is not a metric space, determine which properties of a metric satisfies and which it does not.

In fact, we can make a finite metric space by taking any finite subset of a metric space and use as a metric the restriction of to . illustrates this by letting , , and in . Then is the restriction of the Euclidean metric to the set . Another way to construct a finite metric space is to start with a finite set of points and make a graph with the points as vertices. Construct edges so that the graph is connected (that is, there is a path from any one vertex to any other) and give weights to the edges as illustrated in . We then define a metric on by letting be the length of a shortest path between vertices and in the graph. For example, in this example.   A graph to define a metric.

  "body": " The Hamming Metric  In our society, a great deal of information is communicated electronically. Bank transactions, television programs, military communications, cell phone calls, digital images, and almost any interchange one can think of either can be or is digitized and transmitted electronically. In many situations we need to compare one set of data to another (e.g., Internet searches for text strings or image matches, DNA strands), and metrics are often used for this purpose. Computers work in a binary system, that is they recognize only zeros and ones. So a digital text message is a string of zeros and ones. That is, a digital message is a collection of elements in the space for some positive integer , where . Each element in is called a word - that is, a word is an element in denoted in the form . Just like in the English language, where not every combination of letters corresponds to words that make sense, not every word is recognizable as part of an intelligible message. We might, for example, code the letters of the alphabet by assigning numbers 1-26 to the letters, then make them elements of by converting to binary. The collection of all intelligible words is called a code . So a code is just some subset of that all parties agree are sensible words. The words in a code are called code words . To deal with problems that occur in transmitting digital messages, like scrambling ( encoding ) messages, unscrambling ( decoding ) messages, and detecting and correcting errors in messages, it is useful to have a way to measure distance between words. One way is to use the Hamming metric.   metric Hamming   Let and be words in . The Hamming distance  between and is .    Recall that for each both and are either 0 or 1.

  "title": "The Levenshtein Metric",
  "body": " The Levenshtein Metric  The Levenshtein metric is one measure of distance that researchers use to understand DNA. DNA is composed of double chains of nucleotides, which wind together to form a double helix. The nucleotides come in four types: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). The nucleotides in the two chains of a DNA strand pair together, (A with T, and C with G), so the nucleotides in one chain determine the nucleotides in the other. Therefore, we can represent a DNA strand with a string of letters from the alphabet . One problem DNA researchers have is how to compare two strands of DNA, and the Levenshtein metric is one way that the distance between strands can be measured. Other metrics could be used, but the Levenshtein metric is appropriate to the task for several reasons. During evolution, changes in DNA sequences arise due to nucleotide substitution, or the insertion or deletion of nucleotides. These evolutionary changes can be modeled by the operations that determine the Levenshtein distance better than other metrics. In addition, the Levenshtein metric can be used to calculate distances between strings of different lengths. The Levenshtein metric also has applications in spell checkers, speech recognition, and automated plagiarism detection. To understand how the Levenshtein metric is calculated, consider the question of how far apart the words green and grease are.  To compare these words, we have to be able to change letters, and add or delete letters. If is a string of letters, we allow the following operations:   a deletion:  replace with for some ,    an insertion:  replace with , where is an allowable letter and ,    a substitution:  replace with , where is an allowable letter and .       Using the allowable operations, change the word green into the word grease . Specifically identify each operation you use. (Note: the intermediate strings of letters do not have to form recognizable words.) How many operations did you use?    If it took three operations to transform green into grease , we could say that the distance between green and grease is at most 3. However, it may be possible to transform green into grease in fewer than 3 operations, which might change our opinion of the distance between these words. In general, to define the Levenshtein distance between a sting and a string , let denote the number of deletions, the number of insertions, and the number of substitutions we use to get from to .

  "body": " Introduction  The real numbers have a special property that allows us to, among other things, define the distance between a point and a set in a metric space. It also allows us to define distances between subsets of certain types of metric spaces, which creates a whole new metric space whose elements are the subsets of the metric space. We will examine that property of the real numbers in this activity.  We begin by considering the problem of defining the distance between a real number and an interval in with the Euclidean metric defined by .  Let and let be the closed interval . It is natural to suggest that the distance between the point and the set , denoted , should be the distance from the point to the point in closest to . So in this case we would say .  This might lead us to suggest that the distance from a point to a set , denoted by is the minimum distance from the point to any point in the set, or .  What if we changed the set to be the open interval ? What then should be, or should this distance even exist? If we think of the distance between a point and a set as measuring how far we have to travel from the point until we reach the set, then in the case of and , as soon as we travel a distance more than 1 from in the direction of , we reach the set . So we might intuitively say that as well. But we cannot define this distance as a distance from to a point in since . We need a different way to formulate the notion of a distance from a point to a set.  In a case like this, with and , we can examine the set and notice some facts about this set. For example, the set is a subset of the nonnegative real numbers. Also, in this example there are no numbers in that are smaller than 1. Because of this property, we will call the number 1 a lower bound for . More generally,   lower bound   Let be a nonempty subset of . A lower bound for is a real number such that for all .    If a subset of has a lower bound, we say that is bounded below . So the set is bounded below by 1. The set is also bounded below by 0.5 and 0. In fact, any number less than 1 is a lower bound for . The critical idea, though, is that no number larger than 1 is a lower bound for . Because of this we call 1 a greatest lower bound of . More generally,   greatest lower bound   Let be a nonempty subset of that is bounded below. A greatest lower bound for is a real number such that    is a lower bound for and    if is a lower bound for , then .        infimum A greatest lower bound is also called an infimum . We might now use this idea of a greatest lower bound to define the distance between and as the greatest lower bound of the set . However, there are questions we need to address before we can do so. One question is whether or not every nonempty subset of that is bounded below has an infimum. The answer to this question is yes, and we will take this result as an axiom of the real number system (often called the completeness axiom ).    Does every subset of have a lower bound? Explain. (When a subset of has a lower bound we say that the set is bounded below .)    Which of the following subsets of are bounded below? If the set is bounded below, what is its infimum?

  "body": " The Distance from a Point to a Set  Metrics are used to establish separation between objects. Topological spaces can be placed into different categories based on how well certain types of sets can be separated. We have defined metrics as measuring distances between points in a metric space, and in this activity we extend that idea to measure the distance between a point and a subset in a metric space. However, there are two questions we need to address before we can do so. The first we mentioned in our preview activity. We will assume the completeness axiom of the reals, that is that any subset of that is bounded below always has a greatest lower bound. The second question is whether or not a greatest lower bound is unique.    Let be a subset of that is bounded below, and assume that has a greatest lower bound. In this activity we will show that the infimum of is unique.    What method can we use to prove that there is only one greatest lower bound for ?    Suppose and are both greatest lower bounds for . Why are and both lower bounds for ?    What two things does the second property of a greatest lower bound tell us about the relationship between and ?    Why must the greatest lower bound of be unique?    With the existence and uniqueness of greatest lower bounds considered, we can now say that any nonempty subset of that is bounded below has a unique greatest lower bound. We use the notation (or for infimum of ) for the greatest lower bound of . There is also a least upper bound  least upper bound ( , or for supremum  supremum ) of a subset of that is bounded above.  Now we can formally define the distance between a point and a subset in a metric space.    Let be a metric space, let , and let be a nonempty subset of . The distance from to is .    We denote the distance from to by . When calculating these distances, it must be understood what the underlying metric is.

  "body": " Introduction  We have likely had previous experiences with continuous functions. Continuity is an important consideration in optimization problems because a continuous function attains a maximum value and a minimum value on any closed and bounded interval. Continuous functions also satisfy the Intermediate Value Theorem, that a continuous function takes on all values between and on an interval . An important consequence of the Intermediate Value Theorem is that if is a continuous function on an interval and and have opposite signs, then must have a root in the interval . In this section we will begin to explore continuity of functions between metric spaces. Our ultimate goal in future sections is to understand continuous functions well enough that we can define continuity just in terms of open sets.  In calculus we discuss the idea of continuity. A function (using the standard Euclidean metric) is continuous at a point if .  This involved providing some explanation about what it means for a function to have a limit at a point. Intuitively, the idea is that a function has a limit at if we can make all of the value of as close to as we want by choosing as close to (but not equal to) as we need. To extend this informal notion of limit to continuity at a point we would say that a function is continuous at a point if if we can make all of the value of as close to as we want by choosing as close to as we need (now can equal ).  In order to define continuity in a more general context (in topological spaces) we will need to have a rigorous definition of continuity to work with. We will begin by discussing continuous functions from to , and build from that to continuous functions in metric spaces. These ideas will allow us to ultimately define continuous functions in topological spaces.  We begin by working with continuous functions from to . Our goal is to make more rigorous our informal definition of continuity at a point. To do so will require us to formally defining what we mean by   making the values of  as close to as we want , and    choosing  as close to as we need .      Demonstrating the definition of continuity at a point.       Let's deal with the first statement, making the values of  as close to as we want . What this means is that if we set any tolerance, say , then we can make the values of within of . Since the absolute value measures how close is to , we can rewrite the statement that the values of are within of as . Of course, may not be as close as we want to , so we need a way to indicate that we can make the values of arbitrarily close to  within any tolerance at all. We do this by making the tolerance a parameter, . Then our job is to make the values of within of regardless of the size of . We write this as .  We can picture this as shown at left in . Here we want to make the values of lie within an band of above and below . That is, we want to be able to make the values of lie between and .  Now we have to address the question of how we make the values of to be within of . Since the values are the dependent values, dependent on , we make the values of have the property we want by choosing the inputs appropriately. In order for to be continuous at , we must be able to find values close enough to to force . Pictorially, we can see how this might happen in the image at right in . We need to be able to find an interval around so that the graph of lies in the band around for values of in that interval. In other words, we need to be able to find some positive number so that if is in the interval , then the graph of lies in the band around . More formally, if we are given any positive tolerance , we must be able to find a positive number so that if (that is, is in the interval ), then (or lies in the band around ).  This gives us a rigorous definition of what it means for a function to be continuous at a point.    A function is continuous at a point if, given any , there exists a so that implies .    Note that the value of can depend on the value of and on , but not on values of .    The GeoGebra file online will allow us to play around with this definition. Use this GeoGebra applet for the first two problems in this activity.    Enter as your function. (You can change the viewing window coordinates, the base point , and the function using the input boxes at the left on the screen.) Determine a value of so that whenever . Explain your method.    Now find a value of so that whenever . Explain your method.    What is the negation of the definition of continuity at a point? In other words, what do we need to do to show that a function is not continuous at a point ?   Use the negation of the definition to explain why the function defined by is not continuous at .    "

  "body": " Continuous Functions Between Metric Spaces  In our preview activity we saw how to formally define what it means for a function to be continuous at a point.  Note that depends only on being able to measure how close points are to each other. Since that is precisely what a metric does, we can extend this notion of continuity to define continuity for functions between metric spaces. Continuity is an important idea in topology, and we will work with this idea extensively throughout the semester.  If we let be defined by , then we have seen that is a metric on (note that is the Euclidean metric on ). Using this metric we can reformulate what it means for a function to be continuous at a point.   Alternate Definition   A function is continuous at a point if, given any , there exists a so that implies .    This alternate definition depends on the metric . We could easily replace the metric with any other metric we choose. This allows us to define continuity at a point for functions between metric spaces.   continuity at a point in a metric space   Let and be metric spaces. A function is continuous at if, given any , there exists a so that implies .    Once we have defined continuity at a point, we can define continuous functions.   continuous function   Let and be metric spaces. A function is continuous if is continuous at every point in .

  "body": " Introduction  Open sets are vitally important in topology. We will see later that every topological space is completely defined by its open sets, and continuous functions can be defined just in terms of open sets. In this section we introduce the idea of open balls and neighborhoods in metric spaces and discover a few of their properties. This discussion will form the basis for introducing open sets in the next section.  Recall that the continuity of a function from a metric space to a metric space at a point is defined in terms of sets of points such that and such that for positive real numbers and . In with the Euclidean metric , for real numbers and the set of values satisfying is the set of values so that . We often write this set in interval notation as and call an open interval. An informal reason that we call such an interval open (as opposed to the intervals , , or ) is that the open interval does not contain either of its endpoints. A more substantial reason to call such an interval open is that if is any element in , then we can find another open interval around that is completely contained in the interval . So you could naively think of an open interval as one in which there is enough room in the interval for any point in the interval to wiggle around a bit and stay within the interval.  Since the open interval can be described completely by the Euclidean metric as the set of values so that , there is no reason why we can't extend this notation of open interval to any metric space. We must note, though, that is one-dimensional while most metric spaces are not, so the term interval will no longer be appropriate. We replace the concept of interval with that of an open ball.   open ball in a metric space   Let be a metric space, and let . For , the open ball of radius around is the set .    We note here that our notation for an open ball is not universal. For example, some texts use for our .

We can interpret this definition of continuity to say that for every , the inverse image under of the open ball contains the open ball for some .

As an open ball, an open interval is a neighborhood of each of its points. This is the foundation for the definition of an open set in a metric space.  Recall that we defined a subset of to be neighborhood of point in a metric space if contains an open ball for some . We saw that every open ball is a neighborhood of each of its points, and we will now extend that idea to define an open set in a metric space.    A subset of a metric space is an open set open set in a metric space if is a neighborhood of each of its points.    So, by definition, any open ball is an open set. Also by definition, open sets are neighborhoods of each of their points. Open sets are different than non-open sets. For example, is an open set in using the Euclidean metric, but is not. The reason is not an open set is that there is no open ball centered at that is entirely contained in . So has a different property than the other points in .

  "body": " Introduction  We were introduced to sequences in calculus, and we can extend the notion of the limit of a sequence to metric spaces. Sequences provide an alternate way to describe many ideas in metric space. For example, we will see that we can characterize continuity in terms of sequences, and we can use sequences to determine open and closed sets.  Recall from calculus that a sequence of real numbers is a list of numbers in a specified order. We write a sequence , , , , as or just . If we think of each as the output of a function, we can give a more formal definition of a sequence as a function , where for each .  A sequence of real numbers converges to a number if we can make all of the numbers in the sequence as close to as we like by choosing to be large enough. Once again, this is an informal description that we need to make more rigorous. As we saw with continuous functions, we can make more rigorous the idea of closeness by introducing a symbol for a number that can be arbitrarily small. So we can say that the numbers can get as close to a number as we want if we can make for any positive number . The idea of choosing large enough is just finding a large enough fixed integer so that whenever . This leads to the definition.   limit of a sequence of real numbers   A sequence of real numbers has a limit  if, given any there exists a positive integer (depending only on ) such that .    When a sequence has a limit , we write , or just (since we assume the limit for a sequence occurs as goes to infinity) and we say that the sequence  converges to .    We can draw a graph of a sequence of real numbers as the set of points . In this way we can visualize a sequence and its limit. By definition, is a limit of the sequence if, given any , we can go far enough out in the sequence so that the numbers in the sequence all lie in the horizontal band between and as illustrated in for the sequence .   The limit of the sequence .    To verify that the limit of the sequence is , we start with .    Scratch work. Now we need to find so that implies . Just as with our continuity example, this work is not part of the proof, but shows how we go about finding the we need. To make we need . Now we use this scratch work to design our proof.   Let (so that depends on ). Then for we have .  So the sequence has a limit of .     only applies to sequences of real numbers. Ultimately, we want to phrase the definition in a way that allows us to define limits of sequences in metric spaces and topological spaces. So we have to reformulate the definition in such a way that it does not depend on distances.  Recall that defined a metric on , that is .  So we can rephrase the definition of a limit of a sequence of real numbers as follows.   Alternate Definition   A sequence of real numbers has a limit  if, given any there exists a positive integer (depending only on ) such that .    Once we have described a limit of a sequence in terms of a metric, then we can extend the idea into any metric space.   sequence in a metric space   A sequence in a metric space is a function .    If is a sequence in , we write the sequence defined by as , where . We also use the notation , when . As long as has a metric defined on it, we can then describe the limit of a sequence.   limit of a sequence in a metric space   Let be a metric space. A sequence in has a limit  if, given any there exists a positive integer (depending only on ) such that .    In other words, a sequence in a metric space has a limit if  or that the sequence of real numbers has a limit of . Just as with sequences of real numbers, when a sequence has a limit , we say that the sequence  converges to , or that is a limit of the sequence .    Explain why the sequence converges to 0 in using the Euclidean metric , where .    Consider the sequence in , where is the taxicab metric . Does the sequence converge? If so, find its limit and prove that your candidate is the limit. If not, explain why.    Let in the metric space , where is the discrete metric defined by Does the sequence converge? If so, find its limit and prove that your candidate is the limit. If not, explain why.    "

A reasonable question to ask is if a limit of a sequence is unique. We will answer that question in this activity. Let be a metric space and a sequence in . Assume the sequence has a limit in .

  "body": " Introduction  Once we have defined open sets in metric spaces, it is natural to ask if there are closed sets. Recall that closed intervals are important in calculus because every continuous function on a closed interval attains an absolute maximum and absolute minimum value on that interval. If we have closed sets in metric spaces, we might consider if there is some result that is similar to this for continuous functions on closed sets. In this section we introduce the idea of closed sets in metric spaces and discover a few of their properties.  Every interval of the form in is a closed set using the Euclidean metric. What distinguishes these closed intervals from the open intervals is that the open intervals do not contain either of their endpoints this is what makes an open interval a neighborhood of each of its points. In general, what makes open sets open is that they do not contain their boundaries. If an open set doesn't contain its boundary, then its complement, by contrast, should contain its boundary. This leads to the definition of a closed set.   closed subset of a metric space   A subset of a metric space is closed if its complement is open.    We said that open sets are open because they do not contain their boundary and closed sets are closed because they do contain their boundary. However, we did not define what we mean by boundary. The point on the boundary of an open interval of the form in with the Euclidean metric has the property that every open ball that contains contains points in and points not in . This is what makes the point lie on the boundary. We can also think of the point as being at the very limit of the set . This motivates the next definition.   boundary point in a metric space   Let be a metric space, and let be a subset of . A boundary point of is a point such that every neighborhood of contains a point in and a point in .    For example, in as a subset of , the number 0 is a boundary point of because any open interval in that contains contains points in and points not in . Boundary points can arise in other ways. If as a subset of , then 0 is again a boundary point because any open interval in that contains contains a point ( ) in and points not in . However, is the only point in that is contained in any open interval that contains . In this case we call an isolated point of , and in the case of the set we call an accumulation point or a limit point of (the use of the word limit here will become clear later).   accumulation point in a metric space  limit point in a metric space  isolated point in a metric space   Let be a metric space, and let be a subset of .   An accumulation point or limit point of is a point such that every neighborhood of contains a point in different from .    An isolated point of is a point such that there exists a neighborhood of in with .       You might wonder about the use of the term limit point and how limit points might be related to limits. As we will see later, limit points are limits of sequences, but the definition as we have given is one that will translate directly to topological spaces later.  Note that every boundary point is either an accumulation point or an isolated point. The proof is left as an exercise.    For each of the given sets , find all boundary points, limit points, and isolated points. Then determine if the set is a closed set in the metric space . Explain your reasoning.    , , the Euclidean metric, .    , , the Euclidean metric, .    , is the discrete metric defined by and .    Label each of the following statements as either true or false. If true, provide a convincing argument. If false, provide a specific counterexample.   Every limit point is a boundary point.   Every boundary point is a limit point.   Every limit point is an isolated point   Every isolated point is a limit point.   Every boundary point is an isolated point.   Every isolated point is a boundary point.    "

Recall that the open sets in a metric space satisfied certain properties, including that the arbitrary union of open sets is open and any finite intersection of opens sets is open. We will now take these properties as our axioms in defining topological spaces.   topology   Let be a nonempty set.

  "title": "Bases for Topologies",
  "body": " Bases for Topologies  It can be difficult to completely describe the open sets in a topology. Instead, we can describe the topology using a collection of sets that generate the topology. For example, if is a metric space then the collection of open sets in forms a topology on , called the metric topology. We also saw that in a metric space, every open set in is a union of open balls. For that reason we called the collection of open balls a basis for the open sets in . We can do the same thing in any topological space. As a non-trivial example, an interesting topology defined on the positive integers is due to S.W. Golomb. One can use this topology to prove that there are infinitely many primes. This topology also makes the positive integers into a connected Hausdorff space (more on these concepts later). The Golomb topology is defined as follows. If and are coprime integers in (that is, and have no common positive factors other than 1 so that the greatest common divisor of and is ), let .   Golomb space The collection of sets is a basis for the Golomb topology, and the topological space is called the Golomb space . It is an exercise in number theory to prove that the sets form a basis for a topology, so we will not go into the details.   Let and let . You may assume that is a topology on . Explain why any nonempty open set in the topological space can be written in terms of arbitrary unions and finite intersections of , , and .    shows that, just like the open balls in a metric space, a topology can have a collection of subsets whose unions make up all of the open sets in the topology. We do need to take a little care, though. A basis will generate the collection of open sets for a topology, so the basis sets we start with should themselves be open sets. In addition, every element in the topological space should be an element of one of the basis sets, and since the basis elements are to produce all of the open sets in the topology, every set in the topology (except the empty set) should be a union of sets in a basis. It also must be the case that we can ensure that any finite intersection of sets in the topology remains a set in the topology when we write the sets in the topology in terms of the sets in a basis. To make the last two conditions happen, we will see that it is enough to insist that for any point in the intersection of basis elements, there is another basis element in that intersection that contains the point. This is summarized in .    Let be a set and let be a collection of subsets of such that   For each , there is a set in that contains .    If is an element of for some , then there is a set such that .     Then the set that consists of the empty set and unions of elements of is a topology on .    Before we prove , we will need to know one fact about the set .    Let be a set and a collection of subsets of such that    For each , there is a set in that contains .    If is an element of for some , then there is a set such that .  Let , , , be in . Our goal in this activity is to extend property 2 and show that if , then there is a set such that and .   Since the statement we want to prove depends on a positive integer , we will use mathematical induction. Explain why the and cases are true.   What is the inductive hypothesis and what do we want to prove in the inductive step?   Use the inductive hypothesis and condition 2 to complete the proof of the following lemma.    Let be a set and a collection of subsets of such that   For each , there is a set in that contains .    If is an element of for some , then there is a set such that .     Let , , , be in . If , then there is a set such that and .     Now we can prove .   Let be a topological space, and let and satisfy the given conditions. By definition, . For each there is a set such that . Then , and . To complete our proof that is a topology on , we need to demonstrate that is closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. We first consider unions. Let be a collection of sets in for in some indexing set . By definition, each is empty or is a union of elements of . So either is empty, or is a union of sets in . Thus, and is closed under arbitrary unions.  Now we show that is closed under finite intersections. Let be a positive integer and let a collection of sets in for . Let . If for any , then is in . So suppose that for each between and . Let . Then for each . For every between and , the fact that is a union of elements in implies that there exists with . Thus, .   shows that there is a set such that and . Since is an arbitrary element of , we must have . But each is subset of , so . It follows that and . Therefore, is a topology on .

A set is a basis for a topology (or just a basis ) on if   For each , there is a set in that contains .    If is an element of for some , then there is a set such that .        basis elements  basic open set The elements of a basis are called basis elements or the basic open sets . A basis for a topology on a set defines a topology on as shown in .  Note that because of property (1) of , the union of the sets in the basis must contain . In other words, the sets in a basis cover the space. The second property ensures that if a point is in the intersection of two basic open sets, then there is a smaller basic open set that contains .   topology generated by a basis   Let be a basis for a topology on a set . The topology generated by contains the empty set and all arbitrary unions of basis elements.

We defined interior points in metric spaces in terms of neighborhoods the same holds true in topological spaces.   interior point   Let be a subset of a topological space . A point is an interior point of if is a neighborhood of .    Remember that a set is a neighborhood of a point if the set contains an open set that contains the point. By definition, every open set is a neighborhood of each of its points, so every point of an open set is an interior point of . Conversely, if every point of a set is an interior point, then is a neighborhood of each of its points and is open. This argument is summarized in the next theorem.    Let be a topological space. A subset of is open if and only if every point of is an interior point of .    The collection of interior points in a set form a subset of that set, called the interior of the set.

As a result, we look for conditions on topological spaces under which sequences do exhibit some regular behavior. In our preview activity we saw that it is possible in a topological space that single point sets do not have to be closed. In , we also saw that limits of sequences in topological spaces are not necessarily unique. This type of behavior limits the results that one can prove about such spaces. As a result, we define classes of topological spaces whose behaviors are closer to what our intuition suggests.    Consider a metric space , and let and be distinct points in .   Explain why and cannot both be limits of the same sequence if we can find disjoint open balls centered at and centered at such that .   Now show that we can find disjoint open balls centered at and centered at such that .    Return to our example from with and topology . We saw that every point in is a limit of the constant sequence . If in , Explain why there are no disjoint open sets containing and containing .    It is the fact as described in that we can separate disjoint points by disjoint open sets that separates metric spaces from other spaces where limits are not unique. If we restrict ourselves to spaces where we can separate points like this, then we might expect to have unique limits. Such spaces are called Hausdorff spaces.   Hausdoff space   A topological space is a Hausdorff space if for each pair , of distinct points in , there exists open sets of and of such that .     shows that every metric space is a Hausdorff space. Once we start imposing conditions on topological spaces, we restrict the number of spaces we consider.    Let be any set and the discrete topology. Is Hausdorff? Justify your answer.    Let be a Hausdorff topological space with a finite set. Is an open set? Explain. What does this say about the topology ?   Is a limit point of ?      There are examples of Hausdorff spaces that are not the standard metric spaces. For example, Let . We use to make a topology on with basis all open intervals of the form and all sets of the form , where are real numbers. This topology adds the extra intervals of the form to the standard open intervals to make a new topology. This topology is known as the -topology on . Just as in , if and are distinct real numbers we can separate and with open intervals.    The reason we defined Hausdorff spaces is because they have familiar properties, as the next theorems illustrate.    Each single point subset of a Hausdorff topological space is closed.    Let be a Hausdorff topological space, and let for some . To show that is closed, we prove that is open. Let . Then . So there exist open sets containing and containing such that . So and . Thus, every point of is an interior point and is an open set. This verifies that is a closed set.      A sequence of points in a Hausdorff topological space can have at most one limit in the space.    Let be a Hausdorff topological space, and let be a sequence in . Suppose converges to and to . Suppose . Then there exist open sets of and of such that . But the fact that converges to implies that there is a positive integer such that for all . But then for any . This contradicts the fact that converges to . We conclude that and that the sequence can have at most one limit in .    Hausdorff spaces are important because we can separate distinct points with disjoint open sets. It is also of interest to consider what other types of objects we can separate with disjoint open sets. For example, the indiscrete topology is quite bad in the sense that its open sets can't distinguish between distinct points. That is, if and are distinct points in a space with the indiscrete topology, then every open set that contains also contains . By contrast, in a Hausdorff space we can separate distinct points with disjoint open sets. This is an example of what is called a separation property. Other types of separation properties describe different types of topological spaces. These separation properties determine what kind of objects we can separate with disjoint open sets e.g., points, points and closed sets, closed sets and closed sets. The following are the most widely used separation properties. These properties rule out kinds of unwelcome properties that a topological space might have. For example, recall that limits of sequences are unique in Hausdorff spaces. (We traditionally call these separation properties axioms because we generally assume that our topological spaces have these properties. However, these are not axioms in the usual sense of the word, but rather properties.)   -space  Frechet space  -space  -space  normal topological space  -space   Let be a topological space.   The space is a T -space or Frechet space if for every in , there exist an open set containing such that .    The space is a T -space or a Hausdorff space if for every in , there exist disjoint open sets and such that and .    The space is regular regular topological space if for each closed set of and each point , there exists disjoint open sets and in such that and . The space is a T -space or a regular Hausdorff space if is a regular space.    The space is a normal space if for each pair and of disjoint closed subsets of there exist disjoint open sets and such that and . The space is a T -space or a normal Hausdorff space if is a normal space.        shows that every metric space is both regular and normal. The use of the variable comes from the German Trennungsaxiome for separation axioms. Note again that these are not technically axioms, but rather properties. An interesting question is why we insist that and -spaces also be . We want these axioms to provide more separation as the index increases. Consider a space with the indiscrete topology. In this space, nothing is separated. However, this space is vacuously regular and normal. To avoid this seeming incongruity, we insist on working only with spaces. Note that a space with the indiscrete topology is not .  It is the case that every -space is , every -space is , and every -space is . Verification of these statements are left to . These properties are also all different. That is, there are -spaces that are not and -spaces that are not . These problems are given in . The fact that there are -spaces that are not is a bit difficult. An example is the Niemytzki plane . The Niemytzki plane is the upper half plane . Let be the boundary of . That is, . A basis for the topology on consists of the standard open disks centered at points with along with the open disks in that are tangent to together with their points of tangency. We won't verify that the Niemytzki plane is but not . The interested reader can find an accessible proof in the article Another Proof that the Niemytzki Plane is not Normal by David H. Vetterlein in the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal , Vol. 10, No. 2 (SPRING 1995), pp. 119-121.  "

We have defined neighborhoods in topological spaces, so we can use this characterization as our definition of a continuous function from one topological space to another.   continuity in a topological space   A function from a topological space to a topological space is continuous at a point  if is a neighborhood of in whenever is a neighborhood of in . The function is continuous if is continuous at each point in .    We saw that in metric spaces, a useful characterization of continuity was in terms of open sets. It is not surprising that we have the same characterization in topological spaces. You may assume the result of (the topological space version of for metric spaces) for this activity.

Metric equivalence is a very strong type of equivalence the existence of an isometry does not allow for much flexibility since distances must be preserved. From a topological perspective, we are only concerned about the open sets there are no distances. The open unit ball in and the open ball in (where is the Euclidean metric and is the max metric) are not that different as we can see in . If we don't worry about preserving distances, we can stretch the open ball in along the lines and uniformly in a way to mold it onto the unit ball in . The important thing is that this stretching will preserve the open sets. This is a much more forgiving type of equivalence and maintains the central idea of topology that we have discussed what properties of a space are not altered by stretching and bending the space. This type of equivalence that allows us to manipulate a space without fundamentally changing the open sets is called topological equivalence .   The open unit balls in and .    "

Such a deformation has to be a bijection to ensure that the two sets contain the same number of elements, continuous so that the inverse images of open sets are open, and must be continuous so images of open sets are open. Such a function provides a one-to-one correspondence between open sets in the two spaces. This leads to the next definition.   topologically equivalent   Two topological spaces and are topologically equivalent if there is a continuous bijection such that is also continuous.    Metric equivalence always implies topological equivalence (using the metric topologies), which is left for . So metric equivalence is a stronger condition than topological equivalence.  The function (or ) in is called a homeomorphism .   homeomorphism   Let and be topological spaces. A function is a homeomorphism if is a continuous bijection such that is also continuous.     homeomorphic spaces If there is a homeomorphism from to we say that the spaces to are homeomorphic topological spaces.  It can be difficult to show directly that two metric spaces are homeomorphic, but there are ways to make the process easier in metric spaces. If is a homeomorphism from the metric space to the metric space , the continuity of ensures a smooth deformation from to . In terms of the metrics, this means that distances cannot get distorted too much in fact, the amount distances are distorted should be bounded. In other words, we might expect that there is a constant so that for any . The next theorem tells us that this is a sufficient condition for topological equivalence when we work in the same underlying space.    Let be a set on which two metrics and are defined.

Equivalence relations are important because an equivalence relation on a set partitions the set into a disjoint union of equivalence classes.

That is, the fraction is the quotient of by , and the set of rational numbers is the collection of all defined quotients of integers. The word quotient seems to have come from the latin word quotiens , which can be translated as how often or how many times . We can think of the fraction as dividing a unit ( into two pieces. So we often apply the word quotient to any kind of construction that divides a set into pieces. Another familiar quotient construction is the set , the set of quotients of integers after we divide by . Another way to think of is as a quotient , where is the set of multiples of and two integers and are identified with each other (or are equivalent ) if . This defines the relation of congruence module on , and the elements of are the equivalence classes for this relation. We make similar constructions in many branches of mathematics by defining an equivalence relation on a set, and we then divide the set into pieces (the equivalence classes) and call the set of equivalence classes a quotient space . We explore the concept of quotient spaces of topological spaces in this section.  As an example, take the interval in and bend it to be able to glue the endpoints together. The resulting object is a circle. By identifying the endpoints and of the interval, we are able to create a new topological space. We can view this gluing or identifying of points in the space in a formal way that allows us to recognize the resulting space as a quotient space.  "

Another perspective of the quotient topology utilizes the fact that any equivalence relation on a set partitions into a union of disjoint equivalence classes .

It is straightforward to show that is an equivalence relation, the details are left for . From this we can see that our two approaches to defining the quotient topology and quotient spaces are really the same.  Oftentimes we have a topological space and a relation on , and we would like to have an effective way to be able to identify the quotient space as homeomorphic to some familiar topological space . That is, we want to be able to show that there is a homeomorphism from to .    Consider the following situation. Let with the standard topology and define the relation on by if .

This creates a geometry that extends the concept of the real plane. This new geometry is the real projective plane , which can be thought of as the quotient space of with the relation such that in if and only if there is a nonzero real number such that , , and . In the projective plane, parallel lines intersect at a point at infinity, just as they seem to with our human vision.   Show that is an equivalence relation.   Give a geometric description of the elements in the quotient space .   There are other ways to visualize . For example, explain why the real projective plane is homeomorphic to the quotient space of , where identifies antipodal points on . No formal proofs are necessary, but a convincing explanation is in order.   Since we identify antipodal points on in the space , we can think of this space in another way. If is a point on not on the equator, then its antipodal point is also not on the equator. So we can think of as the top hemisphere, along with the equator on which antipodal points are identified, as illustrated at left in .   Three perspectives of .        By projecting the points on the hemisphere down to the -plane, we can represent as a disk whose antipodal points are identified, as seen in the middle in . Use this last perspective to explain why can be realized as a square where opposite sides are identified in opposite directions as shown at right in .   The projective plane is a complicated object it cannot be embedded in and so it is not something that can be easily visualized. The projective plane is a non-orientable surface and is also important in classifying surfaces basically, every closed surface is made up of spheres, tori, and\/or projective planes. In this part of the exercise we see how the projective plane itself is made by adjoining a M√∂bius strip to a disk (think of sewing the boundary of M√∂bius strip to the perimeter of a disk).   Start with the model of shown at left in . Partition this object into three pieces as shown at right in .

  "body": " Introduction  Closed and bounded intervals have important properties in calculus. Recall, for example, that every real-valued function that is continuous on a closed interval attains a maximum and minimum value on that interval. The question we want to address in this section is if there is a corresponding characterization for subsets of topological spaces that ensure that continuous real-valued functions with domains in topological spaces attain maximum and minimum values. The property that we will develop is called compactness.  The word compact might bring to mind a notion of smallness, but we need to be careful with the term. We might think that the interval is small, but is homeomorphic to , which is not small. Similarly, we might think that the interval is large, but this interval is homeomorphic to the small interval . As a result, the concept of compactness does not correspond to size, but rather structure, in a way. We will expand on this idea in this section.  Since a topology defines open sets, topological properties are often defined in terms of open sets. Let us consider an example to see if we can tease out some of the details we will need to get a useful notion of compactness. Consider the open interval in . Suppose we write as a union of open balls. For example, let for and . Notice that . Any collection of open sets whose union contains is called an open cover of . Working with a larger number of sets is generally more complicated than working with a smaller number, so it is reasonable to ask if we can reduce the number of sets in our open cover of and still cover . In particular, working with a finite collection of sets is preferable to working with an infinite number of sets (we can exhaustively check all of the possibilities in a finite setting if necessary). Notice that for each , so we can eliminate many of the sets in this cover. However, if we eliminate enough sets so that we are left with only finitely many, then there will be a maximum value of so that remains in our collection. But then will not be in the union of our remaining collection of sets. As a result, we cannot find a finite collection of the whose union contains . Note that there may be some collections of open sets that cover of for which there is a finite subcollection of sets that also cover . For example, if we let , then , and . The main point is that there is at least one collection of open sets that covers for which there is no finite subcollection of sets that covers .  Let's apply the same idea now to the set . Suppose we extend our open cover to be an open cover of the closed interval by including two additional open balls in : and . Now the sets , , and form a finite collection of sets that covers . So even though the interval is larger than in the sense that we can represent in a more efficient (that is finite) way in terms of open sets than we can the interval . This is the basic idea behind compactness.   compact subset   A subset of a topological space is compact if for every set and every family of open sets with such that , there exists a finite subfamily such that .    If is a topological space and is a compact subset of , then we say that is a compact topological space . There is some terminology associated with .   cover  cover open   A cover of a subset of a topological space is a collection of subsets of for in some indexing set so that . In addition, if each set is an open set, then the collection is an open cover for .      A subcover of a cover of a subset of a topological space is a collection for , where is a subset of such that . In addition, if is a finite set, the subcover is a finite subcover of .    So the sets , , and in our previous example form a finite subcover of the open cover .  Using the terminology we have now established, we can restate the definition of compactness in the following way: a subset of a topological space is compact if every open cover of has a finite subcover of .    Determine if the subset of the topological space is compact. Either prove is compact by starting with an arbitrary infinite cover and demonstrating that there is a finite subcover, or find a specific infinite cover and prove that there is no finite subcover.     in with the Euclidean topology. Generalize this example.     in with the Euclidean topology.     in with the Euclidean topology.     in with the Euclidean topology.     in with the finite complement topology.     in with the Euclidean topology.    There are two perspectives by which we can look at compactness. If is a topological space and is a subset of , then tells us what it means for to be compact as a subset of . From this perspective, we use open sets in to make open covers of . We can also consider as a subspace of using the subspace topology . From this perspective we can examine the compactness of using relatively open sets for open covers. tells us that these two perspectives are equivalent, so we will use whatever perspective is appropriate for a given situation.

Since we have already shown that is homeomorphic to the topological subspaces , , and for any , we conclude that no open intervals are compact. Similarly, no half-closed intervals are compact. In fact, we will demonstrate in this section that the compact subsets of are exactly the subsets that are closed and bounded. The first step is contained in the next activity.    We have seen that compact sets can be either open or closed. However, in certain situations compact sets must be closed. We investigate that idea in this activity.

Since every metric space is Hausdorff, we can conclude the following corollary.    If is a compact subset of , then is closed.    To classify the compact subsets of as closed and bounded, we need to discuss what it means for a set in to be bounded. The basic idea is straightforward a subset of is bounded if it doesn't go off to infinity in any direction. In other words, a subset of is bounded if we can construct a box in that is large enough to contain it. Thus, the following definition.   bounded subset of   A subset of is bounded if there exists such that , where .    The set in is called the standard  -dimensional cube of size M . A standard 3-dimensional cube of size is shown in .   A standard 3-cube .    An important fact about standard -cubes is that they are compact subsets of . Compactness is a complicated property it is difficult to prove a result that is true about every open cover. As a result, the proof of is quite technical, but it is a critical step to classifying the compact subsets of .    Let . The standard -dimensional cube of size is a compact subset of for any .    We proceed by contradiction and assume that there is an and a positive real number such that is not compact. So there exists an open cover with in some indexing set of that has no finite sub-cover. Let so that is an -cube with side length . Partition into uniform sub-cubes of side length (a picture for is shown at left in ).   Left : . Middle: . Right: Labeling the corners.        Let be one of these sub-cubes. The collection is an open cover of in the subspace topology. If each of these open covers has a finite sub-cover, then we can take the union of all of the s over all of the finite sub-covers to obtain a finite sub-cover of for . Since our cover for has no finite sub-cover, we conclude that there is one sub-cube, , for which the open cover has no finite sub-cover. Now we repeat the process and partition into uniform sub-cubes of side length . The same argument we just made tells us that there is a sub-cube of for which the open cover has no finite sub-cover (an illustration for the case is shown at middle in ). We proceed inductively to obtain an infinite nested sequence of cubes such that for each , the lengths of the sides of cube are and the open cover of has no finite sub-cover. Now we show that .  For , let . That is, think of the point as a lower corner of the cube and the point as an upper corner of the -cube (a labeling for and from 1 to 3 is shown at right in ). Let . We will show that . Fix . We need to demonstrate that .  For each between 1 and we have because is an upper bound for all of the . The fact that our cubes are nested means that for every and . Since is the least upper bound of all of the , property shows that for every . Thus, and so . This shows that for every . Consequently, and is not empty. (The fact that the side lengths of our cubes are converging to 0 implies that , but we only need to know that is not empty for our proof.)  Since is a cover for , there must exist an such that . The set is open, so there exists such that . The maximum distance between points in is the distance between the corner points and , where each length is . The distance formula tells us that this maximum distance between points in is .  Now choose such that . Then if we have and . So . But . So the collection is a sub-cover of for . But this contradicts the fact this open cover has no finite sub-cover. The assumption that led us to this contradiction was that was not compact, so we conclude that the standard -dimensional cube of size is a compact subset of for any .    One consequence of is that any closed interval in is a compact set. But we can say even more that the compact subsets of are the closed and bounded subsets. This will require one more intermediate result about closed subsets of compact topological spaces.    Let be a compact topological space and a closed subset of . In this activity we will prove that is compact.    What does it take to prove that is compact?    Use an open cover for and the fact that is closed to make an open cover for .    Use the fact that is compact to complete the proof of the following theorem.    Let be a compact topological space. Then any closed subset of is compact.      Now we can prove a major result, that the compact subsets of are the closed and bounded subsets. This result is important enough that it is given a name.   The Heine-Borel Theorem   A subset of is compact if and only if is closed and bounded.    Let be a subset of . Assume that is closed and bounded. Since is bounded, there is a positive number such that . shows that is compact, and then shows that is compact.  For the converse, assume that is a compact subset of . We must show that is closed and bounded. Now is a metric space, and so Hausdorff. then shows that is closed. To conclude our proof, we need to demonstrate that is bounded. For each , let .  That is, is the open -cube in . Next let for each . Since , it follows that is an open cover of . The fact that is compact means that there is a finite collection , , , of sets in that cover . Let . Then for each , and so . Thus, is bounded. This completes the proof that if is compact in , then is closed and bounded.    You might wonder whether the Heine-Borel Theorem is true in any metric space.   A subset of a metric space is bounded if there exists a real number such that for all . (This is equivalent to our definition of a bounded subset of given earlier, but works in any metric space.)

  "title": "An Application of Compactness: Fractals",
  "body": " An Application of Compactness: Fractals  Introduced by Felix Hausdorff in the early 20th century as a way to measure the distance between sets, the Hausdorff metric (also called the Pompeiu-Hausdorff metric) has since been widely studied and has many applications. For example, the United States military has used the Hausdorff distance in target recognition procedures. In addition, the Hausdorff metric has been used in image matching and visual recognition by robots, medicine, image analysis, and astronomy.  The basic idea in these applications is that we need a way to compare two shapes. For example, if a manufacturer needs to mill a specific product based on a template, there is usually some tolerance that is allowed. So the manufacturer needs a way to compare the milled parts to the template to determine if the tolerance has been met or exceeded.  The Hausdorff metric is also familiar to fractal aficionados for describing the convergence of sequences of compact sets to their attractors in iterated function systems. The variety of applications of this metric make it one that is worth studying.  To define the Hausdorff metric, we begin with the distance from a point in a metric space to a subset of as .  Since images will be represented as compact sets, we restrict ourselves to compact subsets of a metric space. In this case the infimum becomes a minimum and we have .  We now extend that idea to define the distance from one subset of to another. Let and be nonempty compact subsets of . To find the distance from the set to the set , it seems reasonable to consider how far each point in is from the set . Then the distance from to should measure how far we have to travel to get from any point in to .    Let be a metric space and let and be nonempty compact subsets of . Then distance from to is .

  "body": " Introduction  The term connected should bring up images of something that is one piece, not separated. There is more than one way we can interpret the notion of connectedness in topological spaces. For example, we might consider a topological space to be connected if we can't separate it into disjoint pieces in any non-trivial way. As another possibility, we might consider a topological space to be connected if there is always a path from one point in the spaced to another, provided we define what path means. These are different notions of connectedness, and we focus on the first notion in this section.  Connectedness is an important property, and one that we encounter in the calculus. For example, we will see in this section that the Intermediate Value Theorem relies on connected subsets of . To define a connected set, we will need to have a way to understand when and how a set can be separated into different pieces. Since a topology is defined by open sets, when we want to separate objects we will do so with open sets. This is similar to the idea behind Hausdorff spaces, except that we now want to know if a set can be separated in some way rather than separating points.  As an example to motivate the definition, consider the sets and in with the Euclidean topology. Notice that we can write as the union of two disjoint open sets and . So we shouldn't think of as being connected. However, if we attempt to write as a union of two subsets, say and , it is impossible for both of these subsets to be open and disjoint.

A topological space is connected  connected space if cannot be written as the union of two disjoint, nonempty, open subsets. A subset of a topological space topological space is connected if is connected in the subspace topology.    A separation of a subset of a topological space is a pair of nonempty open subsets and of such that    ,     ,     , and     .   Showing that a set has a separation can be a convenient way to show that the set is disconnected.    The connected subsets of are the intervals and the single point sets.    A subspace of a topological space is a connected component of if is connected and there is no larger connected subspace of that contains .    One application of connectedness is the Intermediate Value Theorem that tells us that if is a connected subset of a topological space and if is a continuous function, then for any and any between and , there is a point such that .    A subset of a connected topological space is a cut set of if the set is disconnected, while a point in is a cut point if is disconnected. The property of being a cut set or a cut point is a topological invariant, so we can sometimes use cut sets and cut points to show that topological spaces are not homeomorphic.     "

For example, the subset is connected in because we can draw a line segment (which we will call a path ) between any two points in and remain in the set . So we might alternatively consider a topological space to be connected if there is always a path from one point in the spaced to another. Although this is a new notion of connectedness, we will see that path connectedness and connectedness are related.  Intuitively, a space is path connected if there is a path in the space between any two points in the space. To formalize this idea, we need to define what we mean by a path. Simply put, a path is a continuous curve between two points. We can therefore define a path as a continuous function.   path   Let be a topological space. A path from point to point in is a continuous function such that and .

  "body": " Path Connectedness as an Equivalence Relation  We saw that we could define an equivalence relation using connected subsets of a topological space, which partitions the space into a disjoint union of connected components. We might expect to be able to do something similar with path connectedness. The main difficulty will be transitivity. As illustrated in , if we have a path from to and a path from to , it appears that we can just follow the path from to , then path from to to have a path from to . But there are two problems to consider: how do we define this path as a function from into our space, and how do we know the resulting function is continuous. The next lemma will help.

So every neighborhood of has as a subset. In addition, when is finite, the set is a finite intersection of open sets, so the sets are open sets (this is not true in general in infinite topological spaces you are asked to find an example in ). In we saw that was path connected for a particular in one example. The next activity shows that this result is true in general in finite topological spaces.    Let be a finite topological space, and let . In this activity we demonstrate that is path connected. Let and define by   To prove that is continuous, let be an open set in . We either have or .

So every point in is contained in some neighborhood with a path connected subset containing . Spaces with this property are called locally path connected .   path connected locally   A topological space is locally path connected at  if every neighborhood of contains a path connected open neighborhood with as an element. The space is locally path connected if is locally path connected at every point.    If is a finite topological space, for any the set is the smallest open set containing . This means that any neighborhood of of will contain as a subset. Thus, a finite topological space is locally path connected (this is not true in general of infinite topological spaces, see for example). One consequence of a locally path connected space is the following.    A space is locally path connected if and only if for every open set of , each path component of is open in .    Let be a locally path connected topological space. We first show that for every open set in , every path component of is open in . Let be an open set in and let be a path component of . Let .

So knowing how to make a product of metric spaces into a metric space still leaves open the question of how we can make the product of topological spaces into a topological space.

Verify your conjecture.    Explain why is continuous.    The same argument as in shows that is also a continuous function. In general, if is a finite product of topological spaces, then the projection is a continuous function for each , where .  Let be a basic open set in , where is a topological space for each . We can extend the result of to see that .  So .  So each basic open set is a finite intersection of sets of the form where is open in . When this happens, we call the collection of sets of the form a subbasis of the topology.   subbasis  subbase   Let be a topological space. A subset of is a subbasis or subbase for if the set of all finite intersections of elements of is a basis for .    As an example, since finite intersections of intervals of the form and give all intervals of the form , the collection is a subbasis for the standard topology on . Note that this collection itself is not a basis for the standard topology on . If is a product of topological space, then another example of a subbasis is the collection .  This set is a subbasis for the product topology on (the verification of this is left to ).   product topology We note here that there is another topology, called the product topology , on with subbasis , where .  For reasons we won't go into, the product topology is preferred to the box topology for infinite products (many important theorems that hold for finite products will not hold for infinite products using the box topology, but will hold using the product topology). However, the product topology and the box topology are the same for finite products, and since we won't consider infinite products here we will not worry about the distinction. For our purposes we will use the terms box topology and product topology interchangeably.  As we have discussed before, it can often be easier to define a topology using a basis or subbasis than it is to describe all of the sets in the topology. As we might expect, since the continuity of a function can be determined by the inverse image of basis elements, the continuity of a function can also be determined by the inverse image of subbasis elements.    Prove .    Let and be topological spaces, let be a subbasis for , and let be a function. If is open in for each , then is continuous.      Recall that is continuous if is open in for each basic open set .    Now suppose that , , and are topological spaces, and that is a function. Then maps to and maps to . Since the composition of continuous functions is continuous, we can see that if is continuous so are and . To determine if is a continuous function, it would be useful to know if the converse is true. A key idea in the proof is the result of that if , , and are sets, and and are functions, then for any subset of .  Now we can use projections to determine when functions to product spaces are continuous.    Let for from to and be topological spaces, and let be a function. Then is continuous if and only if is continuous for each .    Let for from to and be topological spaces, and let be a function. If is continuous, the facts that each is continuous and that composites of continuous functions are continuous show that is continuous for each .  Now suppose that is continuous for each . Recall that is a subbasis for the product topology on . To prove that is continuous, tells us that it is enough to show that is open for each in .

  "body": " Applications of Products of Topological Spaces  Computers represent information from the real world digitally. That is, a computer screen consists of discrete pixels that are used to mimic the continuous information from the real world. So we exist in , but a computer screen represents information in as illustrated in . It is important to be able to accurately mimic the continuous information from digital data. One of the key ideas is to have a digital version of the Jordan curve theorem which states that a Jordan curve (a continuous loop that does not intersect itself) in the Euclidean plane separates the remainder of the plane into two connected components (the inside and the outside of the curve). Additionally, if a single point is removed from a Jordan curve, the remainder of the plane becomes connected. The reason a digital Jordan curve theorem is important is that it is only necessary to save the Jordan curves which determine regions, along with the associated colors of the regions, rather than having to save the color of every single pixel in an image.   Left: The digital plane. Middle: -neighbors of a point. Right: -neighbors of a point.        A natural start to building a digital topology might be to identify neighborhoods. The idea of a neighborhood is to consider elements that are close to a point, and in the digital world there are different ways to do this. Given a point in , the 4-neighbors of are the points vertically or horizontally adjacent to : that is, the points and . The 8-neighbors of are the 4-neighbors along with the points diagonally adjacent to : that is, , , . These neighbors are illustrated in , with the crosses indicating the neighbors of the highlighted point.  In the continuous case, we define a path between points to be a continuous function from to the space. However, we cannot have continuity in the digital world. So we define paths by moving through neighbor points. That is, if is either or , a -path is a finite sequence , , , in such that is a -neighbor of , is a -neighbor of , , and is a -neighbor of .    Show that there is a -path connecting any two points in . Then explain why there is an -path connecting any two points in .    In the continuous case, every Jordan curve separates into two connected regions. To have a similar theorem in the discrete case, we need a notion of connectedness in . Every image is made up of a finite number of pixels, and so we can think of a digital image as existing in a finite subspace of . Since connectedness and path connectedness are equivalent in finite topological spaces, we us the idea of -paths to define connectedness in . We say that a subset of is if if any two of its points can be joined by a -path in . show two sets (curves) in the digital plane indicated by the points that connect the line segments (examples taken from A Topological Approach to Digital Topology, T. Yung Kong, R. Kopperman, and P. Meyer, American Mathematical Monthly , 98 (1991), no. 10, 901-917). Let be the set illustrated at left in and the set at right.   Sets (left) and (right) in the digital plane.       Is  connected? Is  connected? Verify your answer. Repeat with .    We can now define a Jordan -curve to be a finite -connected set which contains exactly two -neighbors for each of its points. Is a Jordan -curve? Is a Jordan -curve? Verify your answer. Repeat with .    As usual, we define a component to be a maximal connected set. Explain why is a Jordan -curve whose complement is connected and why is a Jordan -curve whose complement consists of three connected -components. This example shows that there is no Jordan curve theorem in digital topology using the standard notions of -connectedness with either or . So neither 4-adjacency nor 8-adjacency provides an analogue of the Jordan curve theorem and it is necessary to use a combination of both. That is, a Jordan -curve with at least five points separates into exactly two -components, and a Jordan -curve with at least five points separates into exactly two -components.    In we discussed the importance of a digital Jordan curve theorem. In the next activity we describe a topology in which such a theorem exists.   topology Khalimsky   Consider with the topology with basis , where   This topology is called the digital line topology or the Khalimsky topology on . Notice that all sets of the form are open when is odd.    Show that any set of the form where is even is closed in the digital line topology.    To define a Khalimsky topology on we use the product topology. Explain why the collection of sets where is a basis for the Khalimsky topology on . (This topology was originally published by E. Khalimsky in Applications of connected ordered topological spaces in topology , Conference of math. departments of Povolsia, 1970.)    Now we want to define a digital Jordan curve. Our first step is to define a digital path . Recall that a path in a topological space is a homeomorphism from the interval into the space. So we need the concept of a digital interval. If in , the digital interval  is the set .  The integers and are called the endpoints of the digital interval .   digital path  digital arc   Let be a topological space.   A digital path in is the range of a continuous function from a digital interval to .    A digital arc in X is the range of a homeomorphism from a digital interval to .       Let . Show that is not a digital path but and are digital paths.    To produce a digital Jordan Curve Theorem, we need a definition of a digital Jordan curve.   digital Jordan curve   A digital Jordan curve is a finite connected set with such that is a digital arc for each .  So every digital Jordan curve is a connected set. Show that any finite digital path in is a connected set.     Is every digital interval connected?    The upshot of all of this is the following theorem (a proof can be found in A Topological Approach to Digital Topology, T. Yung Kong, R. Kopperman, and P. Meyer, American Mathematical Monthly , 98 (1991), no. 10, 901-917).    If is a digital Jordan curve in the digital plane , then has exactly two components.    The two components in split the digital plane into an infinite region (the outside) and a finite region (the inside).  Show that is a digital Jordan curve (and thus splits into two connected components).    Digital Jordan curves, as described in , are important in order to have a digital Jordan curve theorem. Christer O. Kiselman presents the following theorem to characterize digital Jordan curves in Discrete Geometry for Computer Imagery , Springer-Verlag, 2000, p. 46-56.    A subset of equipped with the Khalimsky topology is a digital Jordan curve if and only if for some even integer and for all , and and no other points are adjacent to ; moreover each path consisting of three consecutive points , , turns at by or or not at all if is a pure point, and goes straight ahead if is mixed.    We investigate this theorem in the next activity.    We need to first define the appropriate terms. Let be a topological space. Two points and in are adjacent if and the set is connected. Then let to be the intersection of all neighborhoods of . Show that distinct elements and in a topological space are adjacent if and only if or .    A point in is called pure if and have the same parity. Otherwise, the point is mixed . Find if is a pure point or a mixed point.    In we show that the set is not a digital path and so not a digital Jordan curve. Which part of does violate?    In we show that the set is a digital Jordan curve. Show that in , the property from that and and no other points are adjacent to is satisfied for each .    "
